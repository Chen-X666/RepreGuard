Our model accounts for leading-order QCD Compton scattering and quark-antiquark annihilation processes. The calculation was performed across a wide range of photon energies and temperatures expected to be produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The results indicate that virtual photon emission rates increase dramatically with temperature as quark-gluon plasma is formed. Furthermore, low-energy virtual photons could provide detailed information about the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma as it expands and cools. Measurements of virtual photon spectra may therefore help constrain theoretical models and deepen our knowledge of the properties of the earliest known form of matter in the universe. More experiments are still needed to test our model's predictions.",

From this, the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor as afunction of photon mass and energy can be calculated as a one dimensionalintegral over these GEF and parton distribution functions in the plasma.However, for phenomenological studies of experimental data, one needs a simpleempirical formula without involving parton momentum integrations.

They claim that diluting whisky with a small amount of water can actually enhance its taste. Through chemical analysis, the researchers found that adding water causes certain flavor compounds to become more soluble. This allows for more of the whisky's flavors to reach the drinker's tongue. In particular, esters and phenols - which provide aromas of sweetness, vanilla and smoke - are released more generously when whisky is cut with water. The scientists tested several single malt scotches diluted to varying degrees. They found a dilution level of around 60-70% whisky delivered the optimum aromatic experience for most tastes.",

Modules-at-infinity are defined as generalized modules with possible singular vectors subjected to certain compatibility conditions. The key properties of modules-at-infinity are studied, including descriptions of the adjoint module and contragredient module. A useful class of modules-at-infinity called logarithmic modules is introduced and their structure is analyzed.

We further apply these results to study charged black holes in general relativity.

This paper presents a novel encoding method for the Blackwell channel based on reinforced belief propagation. Belief propagation is an inference algorithm that is commonly used for decoding in graphical models. However, it can be susceptible to inaccurate approximations when cycles are present in the graph. The proposed method reinforces belief propagation by incorporating information about the channel and tasking structure into the message updates. In simulation tests, the reinforced belief propagation encoding scheme outperformed existing methods in terms of bit error rate across a range of signal-to-noise ratios for the Blackwell channel. By guiding the message passing process, reinforcement is able to improve the accuracy of approximated beliefs even on graphs with cycles.",

In this paper we proposea new variation of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, named Reinforced BPalgorithm, that turns BP into a solver.

Our findings reveal evidence for changes to the wind properties on timescales as short as a month.

The accretion rate is dominated bya few close `slow wind stars' v_w < 750 km/s, and is consistent with the Bondiestimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. Thisvariability is due to the stochastic in-fall of cold clumps of gas, as inearlier simulations, and to the eccentric orbits of stars.

Projective measurements cause the system to collapse into an eigenstate of the measured observable. When a second projective measurement is performed on the post-measurement state, the results are probabilistic and can be described by the theory. The theory is developed by first reviewing the mathematical formalism of projective measurements and how a single measurement causes wavefunction collapse. It is then shown how the formalism can be extended to describe performing two sequential projective measurements. An equation is derived that calculates the probabilities of obtaining each set of measurement outcomes.",

The joint probability andthe modification term can both be observed in successive projectivemeasurements. The complex modification term is a measure of measurementdisturbance. A selective phase rotation is needed to obtain the imaginary part.This leads to a complex quasiprobability, the Kirkwood distribution. We showthat the Kirkwood distribution contains full information about the state if thetwo observables are maximal and complementary. The Kirkwood distribution givesa new picture of state reduction. In a nonselective measurement, themodification term vanishes. A selective measurement leads to a quantum state asa nonnegative conditional probability.

A discrete-event framework models traffic arrival patterns and the step-by-step processing of transactions over time. Experiments were conducted comparing VOODB simulations to measurements from a commercial OODB. Results demonstrate the model accurately simulates response times, throughput, and resource consumption under different workloads. VOODB fills an important gap as it provides a flexible generic tool for evaluating how design decisions like indexing methods, caching strategies and concurrency control protocols affect OODB performance.

To validate VOODB,performance results obtained by simulation for a given experiment have beencompared to the results obtained by benchmarking the real systems in the sameconditions.

The article also examines open issues such as asymmetries seen in circumstellar envelopes and comparisons of observed mass loss rates to predictions of theoretical models.

Through stellar population modeling, we determine that the high velocity dispersion population has an average age of 100 Myr, suggesting recent in situ star formation.

Traditional risk assessment algorithms often rely on manual feature engineering which can be inefficient and biased. This paper proposes using recursive neural networks for risk assessment to automatically learn representations from raw data. Recursive neural networks are a class of neural network that can handle tree-structured and graph-structured data. The model is applied to two risk assessment problems: credit risk prediction and disease risk prediction using medical records. Results show the recursive neural network approach outperforms traditional algorithms at both tasks, achieving on average 5% higher accuracy.

The algorithms aim to efficiently allocate available spectrum among network users, set optimal transmission power levels, determine high throughput routes between nodes, and prevent congestion along network routes. The distributed spectrum allocation algorithm leverages coordination among neighboring nodes to determine non-overlapping channels. The distributed power control scheme iteratively converges on transmit power levels that improve communication links while limiting interference. A distributed routing protocol establishes multiple node-disjoint paths and congestion-aware packet forwarding to balance traffic load. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal throughput while maintaining low complexity for implementation in large-scale networks. Overall, the distributed approaches presented in this work address fundamental problems in wireless networks through localized coordination and information exchange.",

In order to observe thefundamental duplexing constraint that co-located transmitters and receiverscannot operate simultaneously on the same frequency band, we first devise aspectrum allocation scheme that divides the whole spectrum into multiplesub-bands and activates conflict-free links on each sub-band. We show that theminimum number of required sub-bands grows asymptotically at a logarithmic ratewith the chromatic number of network connectivity graph. A simple distributedand asynchronous algorithm is developed to feasibly activate links on theavailable sub-bands. Given a feasible spectrum allocation, we then designnode-based distributed algorithms for optimally controlling the transmissionpowers on active links for each sub-band, jointly with traffic routes and userinput rates in response to channel states and traffic demands.",

The model uses individual agent-based components that can move and communicate locally with nearby agents. Through simple behavioral rules and local interactions, the agents are able to spontaneously organize into structures and patterns resembling the stages of Dictyostelium development such as aggregation and formation of a migratory slug.

A new framework is introduced incorporating radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations showing that accretion disks are turbulent and outflows are driven by magnetic fields.

This leads to an enhanced overall rateof angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at aninteresting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when vertical transport isimportant, the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at smallradii and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple modeldemonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergentdisk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretiondisk theory.

Testing on a set of amino acid dimers shows that the developed basis sets with the heterolevel approach achieve close to basis set limit quality energies with significantly lower computational cost than conventional methods.",

In this article, we revisit the validity of the FGR through both analytical and numerical calculations. We demonstrate that QDPhTs emerge as a result of the coalescence of two energy levels and the divergence of transition probabilities. Around exceptional points, transition dynamics become non-adiabatic and deviation from the FGR becomes significant. We further map out the full phase diagram as a function of system parameters and identify distinct quantum dynamical phases. Our work establishes QDPhTs as a new paradigm that supersedes the standard FGR description of quantum transitions.

A non-destructive method for measuring bulk density is needed to gain greater insights into soil health and function over time. This paper presents a novel vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation method for soil bulk density analysis. Vibrations caused randomization of soil particle arrangements which altered the conductivity pathways in the soil. An electromagnetic induction sensor was used to measure the conductivity fluctuations during vibration. Tests were conducted on soil samples with known bulk densities between 1.0 to 1.8 g/cm^3 that were subjected to controlled vibrations. The results showed that conductivity fluctuations increased with higher levels of vibration intensity and inversely correlated with soil bulk density.",

The normalized indexwas expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and toreduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment wasconducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions andfour bulk densities.

Through extensive computer simulations, we measure the mean squared displacement of particles over time in the three dimensional lattice. The results demonstrate a subdiffusive regime at short times. At intermediate times, the behavior crosses over to normal diffusion.

The authors develop an algorithm to compute geodesics exactly for spin chains of any length.

This can lead to unnaturally large contributions to the Higgs mass. In this paper, we propose a solution to the little hierarchy problem in gauge mediation using emergent supersymmetry. Emergent supersymmetry is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking which relies on the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. In our model, the messenger fields are charged under a hidden gauge group which is strongly coupled at the messenger mass scale. The strong dynamics of the hidden gauge group generate a large anomalous dimension for the messenger fields, which suppresses their masses.",

The lightest supersymmetric partner, in contrast totraditional gauge mediation, is a neutralino which is also a dark mattercandidate.

Our Godunov-type MHD solver is designed to handle strong shocks, large density and pressure contrasts, and magnetic fields. The integration of the ordinary differential equations is performed using a third-order Runge-Kutta scheme. The code uses a cell-centered finite-volume scheme to solve the MHD equations. The spatial reconstruction of the variables is based on the piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is used to locally increase the resolution where needed, reducing the computational cost.",

The evolution of the magnetic field is formulated interms of so-called Euler potentials which are advected with the fluid and thusguarantee the MHD flux-freezing condition. This formulation is equivalent to avector potential approach and therefore fulfills the$\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{B}=0$-constraint by construction. Extensive tests inone, two and three dimensions are presented.

The films were fabricated using pulsed laser deposition, and their thickness was controlled by the number of deposited pulses. The transport properties of the films were measured using a four-probe technique. The results showed that the films exhibited a metal-insulator transition at a temperature of around 250 K. The resistivity of the films was found to decrease with increasing film thickness. The Hall coefficient of the films was found to be positive, indicating that the films are n-type semiconductors. The magnetoresistance of the films was found to be negative, indicating that the films exhibit ferromagnetic behavior.",

However, a brief oxygenplasma etch allows full recovery of the insulating character of the substrate.The I-V characteristics of the bridges are then fully linear over a large rangeof current densities. We find colossal magnetoresistance properties typical forstrained LCMO on STO but no signature of non-linear effects (so-calledelectroresistance) connected to electronic inhomogeneites. In the metallicstate below 150 K, the highest current densities lead to heating effects andnon-linear I-V characteristics.",

In this work, we study the X-ray emissions from such accretion flows in the dipole magnetic field, considering the thermal and non-thermal processes simultaneously. We find that the thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the accreting matter and the synchrotron emission from the secondary pairs dominate the spectra.

We apply this model to investigate theaccretion shocks of white dwarfs in magnetic cataclysmic variables. We havefound that the incorporation of two-temperature effects could harden the keVX-rays. Also, the dipolar model yields harder X-ray spectra than the standardplanar model if white dwarf is sufficiently massive (>~1M_sun).

The barred galaxies tend to have lower CO velocity dispersions compared with the non-barred galaxies. We find that barred galaxies show a variety of distributions of molecular gas. About 20% of the barred galaxies show the concentration of molecular gas toward the center, while the others do not show such concentration. About 40% of the barred galaxies show the enhancement of molecular gas in the bar region. We also examine the spatial distribution of the peak CO intensity in each galaxy.

We measured radial velocities for 53 cluster member candidates and derived a mean radial velocity of −47.4 ± 0.6 km s−1 and a velocity dispersion of 2.2 ± 0.4 km s−1. The metallicity of the cluster was estimated using the [Fe/H] abundance ratio, yielding a value of −0.26 ± 0.06 dex. We also determined the cluster's reddening, E(B − V) = 0.09 ± 0.02 mag, and distance, 1.82 ± 0.09 kpc. The derived age and metallicity are consistent with NGC 1883 being an old, metal-poor open cluster.",

The new data we obtained allow us to put NGC1883's basic parameters more reliable. We find that the cluster has a meanmetallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.20$\\pm$0.22, from which we infer an age(650$^{+70}_{-70}$ Myr) close to the Hyades one and a Galactocentric distanceof 12.3$^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ kpc. The metal abundance, kinematics, and position makeNGC 1883 a genuine outer disk intermediate-age open cluster.",

We measured the electrical conductivity of graphite as a function of magnetic field and temperature, and observed a series of Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations.

We find that the binary's orbital period and eccentricity are significantly affected by these interactions. In particular, we find that the binary's orbital period can be significantly decreased, and that the binary's eccentricity can be significantly increased.

In particular, charge order, in which the charge distribution exhibits a regular pattern, is often considered as a precursor to superconductivity. The interplay between charge order and lattice distortion, known as electron-lattice coupling, is crucial to understanding the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. In this paper, we investigate the effects of electron-lattice coupling on charge order in $\\theta$-(ET)$_2$X, a quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor. We use a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements to show that the electron-lattice coupling leads to a significant enhancement of the charge order and a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature.

We consider a general class of LDR processes, including fractional Brownian motion and fractional Gaussian noise, and derive their asymptotic distributions under various conditions. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the limiting behavior of duration-driven LDR processes, which can be useful in a variety of applications, such as telecommunications, queuing theory, and finance.Specifically, we first establish the weak convergence of duration-driven LDR processes to a Gaussian process. We then derive the exact form of the limiting Gaussian process and characterize its properties. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the sample mean and sample variance of duration-driven LDR processes and obtain their limiting distributions. Our results are derived using a combination of techniques from probability theory and functional analysis.",

For these processes, we obtain thelimiting distribution of suitably standardized discrete Fourier transforms(DFTs) and sample autocovariances. At low frequencies, the standardized DFTsconverge to a stable law, as do the standardized sample autocovariances atfixed lags. Finite collections of standardized sample autocovariances at afixed set of lags converge to a degenerate distribution. The standardized DFTsat high frequencies converge to a Gaussian law. Our asymptotic results arestrikingly similar for the two DDLRD processes studied.",

The library is based on stellar population synthesis models and takes into account the effects of dust extinction and nebular emission. We use the library to classify and parametrize a sample of unresolved galaxies observed by the Gaia satellite. We find that the majority of the galaxies in our sample are star-forming galaxies with a relatively young stellar population. We also find a small number of galaxies that are either passive or have a very old stellar population.

The model is based on the assumption that GPs are produced by a two-step process: (1) a small-scale primary instability develops in the pulsar magnetosphere, leading to the formation of a pair-starved gap; (2) the primary instability triggers a large-scale secondary instability, which results in the generation of a GP. The model is applied to the Crab pulsar, and the results are compared with the observed properties of Crab GPs. We find that the model can successfully reproduce the main features of Crab GPs, including their luminosity, duration, and spectral properties. The model also provides a new insight into the physical mechanism responsible for the generation of Crab GPs.",

The soft X-ray band (0.5-2 keV) is a key energy range for studying black hole mass in AGN, as it is dominated by the thermal emission from the accretion disk. In this work, we present a new method for estimating black hole mass from soft X-ray spectra, based on the measurement of the flux and spectral slope of the soft X-ray excess. We apply our method to a sample of 100 AGN with high-quality X-ray data, and find that our estimates are consistent with those obtained from other methods.",

We arguethat a standard disk dominates the radiative output for radii larger than acharacteristic transition radius R_c ~ mdot x R_{ISCO}, where mdot is theaccretion rate in Eddington units and R_{ISCO} is the innermost stable orbit.For R_{ISCO} < R < R_c, most of the accretion power is released via non-thermalprocesses.

At early proper times we use similar strategy to show that theenergy density approaches a constant as proper time goes to zero. We thereforedemonstrate that the strong coupling dynamics incorporates the isotropizationtransition in heavy ion collisions.

We demonstrate that the environmental spins can undergo a quantum phase transition from a symmetry-broken symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase to a symmetry-restored trivial phase upon increasing the temperature or decreasing the magnetic field. Such a transition leads to a qualitative change in the system-environment interaction. We show that this change is responsible for the observed non-monotonic temperature and field dependences of decoherence rates.

In this thesiswe solved the generalized Liouville-von Neumann quantum master equation toobtain the dynamics of many-spin systems interacting with a spin bath. We alsosolve the spin dynamics within the Keldysh formalism. Both methods lead toidentical solutions and together gave us the possibility to obtain numerousphysical predictions that contrast well with Nuclear Magnetic Resonanceexperiments. We applied these tools for molecular characterizations,development of new numerical methodologies and the control of quantum dynamicsin experimental implementations.",

We find that the self-energy has a logarithmic singularity at low energies, which is consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem.

Our approach combines analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We first derive a new formula for the dual action, which is expressed in terms of the plaquette variables. The non-perturbative running behavior of the coupling in the dual theory is then determined. We also investigate the phase structure of the dual theory using Monte Carlo simulations. The dual theory is found to exhibit a confinement-deconfinement phase transition, which is in line with the expectations from the color confinement mechanism. We compute the critical temperature for this transition and compare it with the results from other approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of non-abelian Yang-Mills theory and its dual formulation.",

Specifically, we consider three-dimensional SU(2) pure Yang-Mills as anaccessible yet non-trivial case in which the gauge group is non-abelian. Usingmethods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity, wederive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describeMetropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble.

[assistant]: Abstract:Exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent stars, so-called hot Jupiters, are expected to have large day-to-night temperature contrasts and efficient day-to-night heat redistribution. Thermal phase curves, i.e., the variation of the planet's thermal emission as a function of orbital phase, are a powerful tool to probe the day-to-night temperature difference and the day-to-night heat redistribution efficiency. So far, only a handful of hot Jupiters have been observed at thermal wavelengths to construct their thermal phase curves. We present mid-infrared (4.5 \\mum) phase curves of the hot Jupiter WASP-121b observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The phase curves show significant variations with the amplitude of similar to 20%.",

However, accurately describing the transport properties of graphene has proven challenging due to the material's unusual band structure and strong electron-electron interactions. In this paper, we develop a self-consistent theory for graphene transport that takes into account these effects. Our theory provides a unified description of the electronic structure and transport properties of graphene, and it agrees well with experimental data. We believe that our theory will be a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of graphene-based devices.",

The EER model is then transformed into a relational schema. In the third phase, the relational schema is used to create a data warehouse.

Using a combination of observations and simulations, we investigate the relationship between clumping and polarization in hot star winds and develop a model to predict the polarimetric variability of these winds.

In contrast, mixed lubrication regimes exhibit lower wear rates but higher friction coefficients. The study also explores the influence of surface roughness and contact pressure on frictional behavior. The findings have important implications for the design of components operating under harsh conditions, such as those encountered in aerospace and automotive applications.

The simulation takes into account various factors that can affect the charging process, such as solar wind, cosmic rays, and other space weather phenomena. The results show that the charging rate of ASTROD I is highly variable and can be affected by a variety of disturbances, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The study also investigates the impact of different charging scenarios on the spacecraft's power system and propulsion performance. The results indicate that effective charging strategies can significantly improve the spacecraft's overall performance and reduce the risk of power loss. Furthermore, the study discusses the implications of the simulation results for future space missions and highlights the need for further research on spacecraft charging dynamics.",

It will useinterferometric and pulse ranging techniques between the spacecraft and groundstations, to make high precision measurements of the parameters that describethe solar system, and to test relativistic gravity with improved accuracy. Atthe heart of the spacecraft is a test mass, which the spacecraft will followusing a drag-free control system. The mission critically depends on maintainingthe geodesic motion of the test mass. Charging of the test mass due to cosmicrays and solar particles will disturb its geodesic motion. We have modelled thecharging process using the GEANT4 toolkit and a simplified, geometrical modeland estimate that the ASTROD I test mass will charge positively, at a rate of24 +/-7 e+/s, due to cosmic ray protons and alpha particles (3He and 4He) atsolar minimum.",

Moreover, we show that the inclusion of Einstein's λ term enables the realization of a stable de Sitter universe, which is in harmony with recent observations suggesting the presence of a positive cosmological constant.

Our results show that the quadrupole-dipole interaction gives rise to a novel type of exciton, which exhibits a strong coupling between the quadrupole and dipole moments. This hybrid exciton leads to a substantial increase in the second-harmonic generation efficiency, making it a promising candidate for applications in nonlinear optical devices.

The benefit of holographic models based on D-brane configurations isthat both sides of the holographic duality are well understood. We find thatthe lightest technicolor resonances contribute negatively to thePeskin-Takeuchi S-parameter, but heavy resonances do not decouple and leadgenerically to large, positive values of S, consistent with standard estimatesin QCD-like theories. We study how the S parameter and the masses and decayconstants of the vector and axial-vector techni-resonances vary over aone-parameter family of D8-brane configurations. We discuss possibilities forthe consistent truncation of the theory to the first few resonances and suggestsome generic predictions of stringy holographic technicolor models.",

Intermediate-mass subgiants are stars with masses between 2.3 and 5 solar masses that have evolved from the main sequence and are now in the subgiant branch stage. The study uses a combination of radial velocity and transit photometry observations to detect exoplanets orbiting these stars. The results show that all three stars have planetary systems, with a total of five exoplanets discovered. The planets are gas giants with masses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 Jupiter masses and orbital periods between 20 and 100 days. The presence of retired A-type stars as companions to these subgiants suggests that the planets may have undergone tidal migrations, leading to their close-in orbits.",

The proposed mechanism utilizes a generic signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and division, allowing for adaptive adjustments to growth rates in response to changing environmental conditions. This pathway integrates signals from multiple sources, including nutrient availability, cell density, and environmental stressors, to modulate cell growth and proliferation. The mechanism can be tuned to different cell types and growth conditions, enabling optimal growth rates for various biological systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this mechanism through simulations and experiments using E. coli as a model organism. Our results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively regulate growth rates in response to changing environmental conditions, resulting in improved cellular performance and robustness.",

In general, changes inprotein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution anddegradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In anadaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is lessaffected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms arelarge, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cellsare easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from acellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated.",

Our proposed method leverages advanced compression techniques and network coding strategies to achieve significant reductions in transmission costs, while maintaining high levels of data quality and accuracy. Through simulations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms traditional methods in terms of cost and performance. Our findings have important implications for a wide range of applications, including multimedia streaming, wireless sensor networks, and distributed data storage systems. Furthermore, our approach is designed to be scalable and adaptable to various network configurations, making it a valuable contribution to the field of distributed source coding.",

The aim is to find the optimal rates at whichthe sources should be compressed and the network flows using which they shouldbe transmitted so that the cost of the transmission is minimal. We considernetworks with capacity constraints and linear cost functions. The problem iscomplicated by the fact that the description of the feasible rate region ofdistributed source coding problems typically has a number of constraints thatis exponential in the number of sources. This renders general purpose solversinefficient. We present a framework in which these problems can be solvedefficiently by exploiting the structure of the feasible rate regions coupledwith dual decomposition and optimization techniques such as the subgradientmethod and the proximal bundle method.",

We observe that the edge-oxidized ZGNRs exhibit a unique electronic structure, characterized by a large gap at the Dirac points, which is absent in pristine ZGNRs.

The results indicate that black holes and their host spheroids grow in tandem, with the black hole mass being a constant fraction of the host galaxy mass. The authors suggest that this correlation is likely due to the self-regulation of feedback mechanisms. Furthermore, the study finds that the star formation rate in these quasars is suppressed compared to that in non-active galaxies, indicating that the quasar activity may play a role in regulating star formation in the host galaxy. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies in the early universe.",

By solving these equations, we are able to compute the equation of state, which we find to be in good agreement with existing results.

With the advent of new technologies, it has become possible to probe the atomic spectrum of helium with unprecedented precision, allowing for a deeper understanding of the properties of this fundamental element. Direct frequency comb spectroscopy is a technique that utilizes a laser to generate a spectrum of frequencies that can be used to probe the absorption and emission lines of atoms. By analyzing the resulting spectra, researchers can determine the atomic transition frequencies with high precision, leading to a more accurate understanding of the atomic structure of helium. This technique has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of atomic physics and pave the way for new applications in fields such as quantum computing and precision measurement.",

To take advantageof this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of thetriplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trapmetastable 2^3S state atoms.

We find that the strength and shape of the BALs are strongly dependent on the viewing angle and the properties of the accretion disk, providing a means to probe the physical conditions in the inner regions of AGN.

The presented algorithm is able to adapt to changing network conditions and provides optimal QoS routing solutions that satisfy the constraints of all packets while minimizing resource utilization. The proposed approach is evaluated using extensive simulations, which demonstrate its superiority over traditional QoS routing methods. The results show that the proposed approach achieves better QoS provisioning and improved resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of QoS routing and soft constraint logic programming, and has important implications for the design and operation of future communication networks.",

The second stepconsists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint LogicProgramming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the bestpaths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed onthem (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics.

This symmetry-breaking behavior has been of interest to researchers for decades, as it provides insight into the fundamental principles governing the universe. The concept of parity doubling has been observed in a variety of contexts, including in the study of mesons and baryons. By understanding the origins of parity doubling, scientists are able to better grasp the underlying symmetries and dynamics of particle interactions. Recent experimental evidence has further supported the existence of parity doubling in particle physics, leading to new discoveries and theoretical advancements in the field. The implications of parity doubling extend beyond theoretical physics, with potential applications in technologies such as quantum computing and high-energy particle accelerators.",

Recently new experimental dataon light mesons caused much excitement and renewed interest to the phenomenon,which still remains to be enigmatic. The present retrospective review is anattempt to trace the history of parity doubling phenomenon, thus providing akind of introduction to the subject. We begin with early approaches of 1960s(Regge theory and dynamical symmetries) and end up with the latest trends(manifestations of broader degeneracies and AdS/QCD). We show the evolution ofvarious ideas about parity doubling. The experimental evidence for thisphenomenon is scrutinized in the non-strange sector. Some experiments of 1960sdevoted to the search for missing non-strange bosons are re-examined and it isargued that results of these experiments are encouraging from the modernperspective.",

Specifically, we examine the effects of pinning on the interface dynamics and how it interacts with disorder. Our results suggest that even strong pinning is not sufficient to completely stabilize the interface in two dimensions. The presence of disorder, particularly in the form of random pinning centers, leads to a complex interplay between pinning forces and thermal fluctuations. We find that the interface remains highly dynamic with a significant degree of roughness, even in the presence of strong pinning. Additionally, we observe that the system exhibits a range of different scaling behaviors depending on the strength of the pinning forces. Our findings highlight the challenges in controlling and stabilizing continuous interfaces in two dimensions, even with strong pinning mechanisms.",

The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlapbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction tolocalization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows thatin higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when thepinning force tends to infinity.",

Interestingly, we found that the degree of robustness varied depending on the location and size of the lesion, with certain regions being more critical for maintaining network integrity. Additionally, we observed that the network's ability to reorganize and compensate for lesions played a crucial role in preserving overall functionality.

In this article, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the prompt emission of high energy photons from GRBs, including the observed characteristics and theoretical models proposed to explain them.

Kerr spacetimes are characterized by their rotating black holes, which introduce complex gravitational effects on test particles orbiting them. Circular orbits are those in which a particle maintains a fixed distance from the black hole, while non-circular orbits exhibit varying distances. The nearly horizon-skimming nature of these orbits refers to their proximity to the event horizon of the black hole. The dynamics of such orbits are of interest due to their potential impact on the accretion processes that occur around black holes. In this paper, we analyze the properties of these orbits and their stability in Kerr spacetimes. We find that circular orbits are more stable near the event horizon compared to non-circular orbits.",

The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.",

The source's position in the sky and its characteristics make it a promising target for further study in order to confirm its annual modulation behavior. The candidate's unique properties set it apart from other IDV sources and make it an intriguing subject for research.

We observe the emergence of spin solid phases with different ordering patterns, including collinear and non-collinear arrangements. Additionally, we find that the spin solid phases exhibit distinct magnetic properties, such as spin correlations and magnetic entanglement.

By comparing the observed properties of the galaxy cluster with simulated models incorporating different values of the self-interaction cross-section, we are able to place limits on this crucial parameter. Our results show that a non-zero, but still relatively small, self-interaction cross-section is favored by the data.

The use of multipole moments allows for a more concise and efficient representation of these functions.

These multipole moments capture the global and local aspects of the function on the quadratic surface. The decomposition process provides valuable insights into the underlying structure and symmetries of the functions.

For such a system, we present ageneral method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleationrates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, whichpredicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when thenew phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rateof a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phasesaccessible from it.",

Existing algorithms for calculating the hypervolume indicator can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.

The algorithm is based on the decomposition of the hypervolume into subvolumes, which are then aggregated to obtain the final hypervolume value.

Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of computational complexity and accuracy in calculating the hypervolume indicator.",
