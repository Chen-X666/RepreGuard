We developed a theoretical model to calculate the virtual photon emission rates from quark-gluon plasma. Our model accounts for leading-order QCD Compton scattering and quark-antiquark annihilation processes. The calculation was performed across a wide range of photon energies and temperatures expected to be produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The results indicate that virtual photon emission rates increase dramatically with temperature as quark-gluon plasma is formed. Furthermore, low-energy virtual photons could provide detailed information about the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma as it expands and cools. Measurements of virtual photon spectra may therefore help constrain theoretical models and deepen our knowledge of the properties of the earliest known form of matter in the universe. More experiments are still needed to test our model's predictions.",
        "human_text": "We recently proposed an empirical approach for the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal(LPM) effects in photon emission from the quark gluon plasma as a function ofphoton mass. This approach was based on Generalized Emission Functions (GEF)for photon emission, derived at a fixed temperature and strong couplingconstant. In the present work, we have extended the LPM calculations forseveral temperatures and strong coupling strengths. The integral equations for(${\\bf \\tilde{f}(\\tilde{p}_\\perp)}$) and ($\\tilde{g}({\\bf \\tilde{p}_\\perp})$)are solved by the iterations method for the variable set\\{$p_0,q_0,Q^2,T,\\alpha_s$\\}, considering bremsstrahlung and $\\bf aws$processes. We generalize the dynamical scaling variables, $x_T$, $x_L$, forbremsstrahlung and {\\bf aws} processes which are now functions of variables$p_0,q_0,Q^2,T,\\alpha_s$. The GEF introduced earlier, $g^b_T$, $g^a_T$,$g^b_L$, $g^a_L$, are also generalized for any temperatures and couplingstrengths. From this, the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor as afunction of photon mass and energy can be calculated as a one dimensionalintegral over these GEF and parton distribution functions in the plasma.However, for phenomenological studies of experimental data, one needs a simpleempirical formula without involving parton momentum integrations. Therefore, wepresent a phenomenological formula for imaginary photon polarization tensor asa function of \\{$q_0,Q^2,T,\\alpha_s$\\} that includes bremsstrahlung and $\\bfaws$ mechanisms along with LPM effects.",

They claim that diluting whisky with a small amount of water can actually enhance its taste. Through chemical analysis, the researchers found that adding water causes certain flavor compounds to become more soluble. This allows for more of the whisky's flavors to reach the drinker's tongue. In particular, esters and phenols - which provide aromas of sweetness, vanilla and smoke - are released more generously when whisky is cut with water. The scientists tested several single malt scotches diluted to varying degrees. They found a dilution level of around 60-70% whisky delivered the optimum aromatic experience for most tastes. The researchers believe their findings help explain why the traditional way of enjoying whisky involves a splash of water.",

We also got an order of their smoked wings which were flavorful with a nice burn from the seasoning. Service from the bartenders was attentive without being overbearing. Prices had risen some but were still reasonable for a neighborhood bar in Buckhead. The bathroom facilities were clean if a bit small and dated.

The store is cramped and outdated, with barely enough room to navigate down the narrow aisles. The fluorescent lights glare harshly off dingy white tiles, and the smell of stale food lingers in the air. Customers are forced to squeeze by one another as they search for meager selections of overpriced products. No effort has been made to update the shop in decades, with scratched plastic signs and faded labels that are nearly impossible to read. Employees appear as miserable as the customers, moving lethargically as if wading through water. It's a wonder how any business can stay open looking and feeling as rundown as Goat Wagon Grocery. The parking lot is cracked and pitted, and what passes for landscaping are a few scraggly weeds pushing up through the asphalt. Unless living within walking distance, there are far better grocery options just a short drive down the road. This store depends entirely on lazy locals who can't be bothered to go elsewhere. Ultimately, the only saving grace is its address - if it were located anywhere else, Goat Wagon Grocery would have gone under years ago.",

The device consists of a planar multilayer structure with ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers fabricated using sputtering deposition. A transition metal layer acts as a polarizer whose magnetization direction can be reversed electrochemically. Numerical simulations show that applying a voltage across the multilayer structure produces a spin-polarized current capable of switching the free layer magnetization. Experimental characterization of prototypes demonstrates reliable toggling of the free layer between parallel and antiparallel states with low operating voltages. This dynamically reconfigurable spin-transfer device could enable new approaches for spintronic memory and logic applications.",

In this case magnetization shows effectivelyin-plane dynamics with only one angle required for its description. Moreover,the motion can become overdamped even for small values of Gilbert damping. Wederive the equations of effective in-plane dynamics in the presence ofspin-transfer torques. The simplifications achieved in the overdamped regimeallow to study systems with several dynamic magnetic pieces (``free layers'').A transition from a spin-transfer device with a static polarizer to a devicewith two equivalent magnets is observed. When the size difference between themagnets is less than critical, the device does not exhibit switching, but goesdirectly into the ``windmill'' precession state.",

But one morning he woke up with shining blue fur and a charming smile. At first he was delighted, preening in front of his reflection for hours. But soon he realized something was very wrong. Whenever he had a cruel thought, his beautiful fur became dingier and his smile twisted into a sneer. He tried to resist the dark ideas swirling in his head, but it was no use. By noon his appearance matched his rotten soul. The children who used to mock him now crossed the street in fear. That evening, a plan emerged to torment the village once and for all. As night fell, Mr. Fluffkins crept from house to house, slipping poison into the wells. But with each wicked act, his curse took hold ever stronger. By dawn, his mangled form shocked even him. Unable to stand his monstrous reflection, he fled into the woods. The villagers rejoiced at being rid of the demon cat, though shadows remained where his pawprints used to be.

Previous research has shown single DNA molecules can transition between coiled and stretched conformations, but the dynamics of these transitions are not fully understood. Here, we develop an experimental technique using optical tweezers to controllably manipulate individual giant lambda phage DNA molecules. Our results demonstrate clear hysteresis in the conformational switching of DNA as we varied the stretching force applied. Specifically, we find the force threshold for transitioning from a coiled to stretched state is higher than the reverse transition. These findings provide new insights into nonequilibrium energetic effects influencing DNA conformation at the single molecule level. Further exploring conformational hysteresis could help explain DNA's packing and unpacking dynamics in vivo.",

Toelucidate the observed hysteresis, a semiflexible chain model is studied byusing Monte Carlo simulations for the coil-globule transition. In thesimulations, the hysteresis loop emerges for stiff enough chains, indicatingdistinct pathways for folding and unfolding processes. Also, our results showthat globular state is thermodynamically more stable than coiled state in thehysteresis loop. Our findings suggest that increasing chain stiffness mayreduce the chain conformations relevant to the folding pathway, which impedesthe folding process.",

This research report observes a two-particle Aharonov-Bohm interferometer to demonstrate quantum interference between two independent electrons. The device utilizes a nanofabricated solid-state circuit containing quantum dots to isolate and emit two individual electrons simultaneously. These electrons are sent along eigenpaths that are separated yet entangled, resulting in an interference pattern that depends on the relative phase between the paths. Varying an applied magnetic field induces an Aharonov-Bohm phase that modulates the interference visible in the two-electron current cross-correlation measurement. Clear oscillations in this measurement provide direct evidence of two-particle Aharonov-Bohm interference.

Here we report the firstobservation of such interference fringes between two independent andnon-interacting electrons in an interferometer proposed by Yurke et al. andSamuelsson et al. Our experiment resembles the \"Hanbury Brown and Twiss\" (HBT)experiment, which was performed with classical waves. In the experiment, twoindependent and mutually incoherent electron beams were each partitioned intotwo trajectories. The combined four trajectories enclosed an Aharonov-Bohm (AB)flux (but not the two trajectories of a single electron). While individualcurrents were found to be independent of the AB flux, as expected, thecross-correlation between current fluctuations in two opposite points acrossthe device exhibited strong AB oscillations. This is a direct signature oforbital entanglement between two electrons even though they never interact witheach other.",

Dyons are particles that carry both electric and magnetic charges. When a scalar potential is introduced, the equations of motion and quantization conditions for dyons are modified. We show that the equations remain self-dual under electric-magnetic duality rotations. This duality relates dyons with different charges but the same mass, supporting the proposal that electric and magnetic charges are different manifestations of the same quantum number. We further apply these results to study charged black holes in general relativity. By treating the horizon area as an adiabatic invariant, we derive the first law of black hole thermodynamics generalizing previous results to include dyonic black holes with scalar potentials.

The police force announced plans to shut front desks at stations between certain hours each night. This move has been condemned by the public services union Unison as too radical and extreme. The union argues that closing front desks overnight could delay emergency responses and reduce access to policing services for vulnerable people. A Unison spokesperson stated that front desks provide an important community service and role in handling enquiries, reporting issues and acting as a visible police presence. However, Northumbria Police maintains that the closures are necessary to streamline services and meet budget cuts, while vital policing resources will still be on call overnight.",

FeSt 1-457 is a nearby starless dense core that was previously thought to be stable and on the verge of star formation. However, new submillimeter observations of FeSt 1-457 reveal variations in its integrated dust emission over four epochs spanning 7 years. These variations suggest the core may be dynamically pulsating like a protostar. Over shorter timescales of a few years, the total mass of FeSt 1-457 was found to fluctuate up to 20%. Such fluctuations could promote fragmentation if they persist over many pulsation cycles. Numerical simulations of globule dynamics are presented and indicate that pulsation is a possible explanation for the observed variability. The simulations explore various mechanisms capable of driving pulsations in starless cores. However, secular contraction or accretion flows from a larger scale ambient cloud are still viable alternative explanations for the long-term evolution of FeSt 1-457. Further monitoring of this intriguing object is needed to constrain models of its dynamical state and better understand the initial conditions for star formation in dense cores on the verge of collapse.",
        "human_text": "High resolution molecular line observations of CS, HCO+, C18O and N2H+ wereobtained toward the starless globule FeSt 1-457 in order to investigate itskinematics and chemistry. The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed andasymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observedasymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in theouter layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic andsignificantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of ourobservations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule isgravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggestthat the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of theouter layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state nearhydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internalsupport. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsationwould be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule dueto the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for thedouble-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinctionmaps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinctiondata provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ whileN2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visualextinction.",

This study presents an analysis of 73 extinction curves spanning infrared through ultraviolet wavelengths to characterize their morphological properties. The curves are classified into five groups based on their curvature parameter R(V) and the width of the 2175 Å extinction feature. Trends between curve shape parameters and observational properties of the lines of sight are investigated. Most curves exhibit a smooth Drude profile for the UV bump feature, though some show significant deviations that are correlated with R(V). Smaller R(V) curves typically have stronger far-UV rises and weaker UV bumps than average Milky Way curves. The results are compared to predictions from dust grain models containing various sizes and compositions. Variations in the size distribution and carbonaceous content of dust populations along different sightlines can account for the observed diversity of extinction curve shapes. This comprehensive morphological analysis provides new constraints for interstellar dust models and improves our understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and dust grain properties in the diffuse interstellar medium.",

We use a new technique which employs stellaratmosphere models in lieu of unreddened \"standard\" stars. This technique iscapable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. Italso allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigoroustesting of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters,regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of thecurves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings,the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, itswidth is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strongcorrelations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region,and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme(i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinctioncurves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightlinevariation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curvewill always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an averagecurve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result insignificant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED mustinclude the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed largesightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among thevarious features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterizeaverage extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respondsensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially uniqueinformation about the grains along its sightline.",

The show had such an intriguing premise about salmon swimming upstream, but it failed to deliver an engaging story. The characters weren't very likable or well developed, so it was hard to care about their struggles. There was also very little plot progression from episode to episode. It felt like the writers didn't have a clear plan for where the story was headed. Several episodes got bogged down showing the fish just swimming in circles with no real development. The attempts at humor fell flat and felt forced. It tried to be a comedy, but the jokes weren't funny. About halfway through the season, I lost interest and had to force myself to keep watching. The beautiful scenery of the rivers and streams could only hold my attention for so long. It needed stronger writing and character development to hold my long-term interest. Unfortunately, there was never enough substance below the surface to make the show compelling. By the season finale, I was glad it was over and had no desire to watch another season.

After over a week with no contact, I finally got a weak signal on my satellite phone. My heart soared when I heard your voice, and I apologized for any doubts. A scientist at the nearby research station helped me send you photos of my journey. Slowly, your faith in my devotion was restored.

This paper presents a novel encoding method for the Blackwell channel based on reinforced belief propagation. Belief propagation is an inference algorithm that is commonly used for decoding in graphical models. However, it can be susceptible to inaccurate approximations when cycles are present in the graph. The proposed method reinforces belief propagation by incorporating information about the channel and tasking structure into the message updates. In simulation tests, the reinforced belief propagation encoding scheme outperformed existing methods in terms of bit error rate across a range of signal-to-noise ratios for the Blackwell channel. By guiding the message passing process, reinforcement is able to improve the accuracy of approximated beliefs even on graphs with cycles. The results demonstrate that the presented encoding approach is an effective and efficient way to communicate over this challenging class of channels.",

However, the dynamics and physical processes driving variability in the stellar winds leaving these stars remain poorly understood. In this study, we present new multi-wavelength observations of the galactic center probing the accretion and emission properties of stellar winds from a sample of known variables. Our findings reveal evidence for changes to the wind properties on timescales as short as a month.

Since wind velocities were revised upwards and non-zeroeccentricities were considered, our new simulations show fewer clumps of coldgas and no conspicuous disc-like structure. The accretion rate is dominated bya few close `slow wind stars' v_w < 750 km/s, and is consistent with the Bondiestimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. Thisvariability is due to the stochastic in-fall of cold clumps of gas, as inearlier simulations, and to the eccentric orbits of stars. The present modelsfail to explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years ago impliedby Integral observations, but we argue that the accretion of a cold clump witha small impact parameter could have caused it. Finally, we show the possibilityof constraining the total mass-loss rate of the `slow wind stars' using nearinfra-red observations of gas in the central few arcseconds.",

They had promised to stay in touch but life got busy and their communication slowly faded. Today was their high school reunion and James couldn't wait to see Amanda again, to catch up on everything they had missed in each other's lives. He arrived at the venue and began searching the crowds of familiar yet older faces for her recognizable smile. After several minutes searching with no sign of her, his hope began to fade. He wondered if she would even show up after so much time apart. Just as he was about to give up, he spotted her across the room. His heart leapt at the sight of her still-red hair and bright eyes. Weaving through the crowds, he called her name. She turned and their eyes met, the years melting away in an instant. \"James!\" she cried, embracing him warmly. He breathed in the familiar scent of her shampoo, immediately transported eight years into the past. Pulling back, they simply smiled, taking in how the other had changed yet remained the same. \"I can't believe it's really you,\" Amanda said. James smiled, \"I know, it's been too long. But we're here now, and we have all night to catch up. I want to hear everything I've missed about your life. \"From that moment on, they didn't leave each other's sides as the reminisced about old memories and shared new stories.",

Projective measurements cause the system to collapse into an eigenstate of the measured observable. When a second projective measurement is performed on the post-measurement state, the results are probabilistic and can be described by the theory. The theory is developed by first reviewing the mathematical formalism of projective measurements and how a single measurement causes wavefunction collapse. It is then shown how the formalism can be extended to describe performing two sequential projective measurements. An equation is derived that calculates the probabilities of obtaining each set of measurement outcomes. The theory is experimentally verified by applying it to analyze data from a double-slit measurement experiment performed on single photons. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with the predicted probabilities. This work lays out the mathematical framework for systematically analyzing experiments involving multiple successive projective measurements.",

The joint probability andthe modification term can both be observed in successive projectivemeasurements. The complex modification term is a measure of measurementdisturbance. A selective phase rotation is needed to obtain the imaginary part.This leads to a complex quasiprobability, the Kirkwood distribution. We showthat the Kirkwood distribution contains full information about the state if thetwo observables are maximal and complementary. The Kirkwood distribution givesa new picture of state reduction. In a nonselective measurement, themodification term vanishes. A selective measurement leads to a quantum state asa nonnegative conditional probability. We demonstrate the special significanceof the Schwinger basis.",

We compare the temperature and luminosity of our candidates to theoretical evolutionary models to estimate their masses and ages.

But I had skills they didn't know about. Gripping my pan tightly, I dashed between the trees as bullets flew overhead. With a well-aimed throw, I knocked the pistol from the hand of the first gang member. My team opened fire now that we had the element of surprise. The leader swore and pulled out an assault rifle. Ducking behind a wide trunk, I paused to catch my breath.Peering around, I saw my opportunity. In one smooth motion, I leapt out and ran forward. With a graceful spin, the pan made contact with the rifle and sent it spiraling away. The leader cursed and pulled a knife instead. My blood pumped as we faced off in hand to hand combat. Metal clanged against metal as our weapons collided. The rest of the gang had surrendered seeing their leader bested. With a well-timed block and strike, his knife went flying into the grass. \"It's over,\" I said, keeping the pan raised warningly. He glared furiously but held up his hands in defeat. The days of their criminal operations were finished, thanks to an unlikely weapon and some skills they failed to see coming.",

Here we investigate the role of cosmic priors on deriving these tightbounds on geometry, by considering a landscape motivated scenario with anoscillating curvature term. We perform a likelihood analysis of current dataunder such a model of non-trivial geometry and find that the uncertainties oncurvature, and correspondingly on parameters of the matter and dark energysectors, are larger.

Pulsation of the star and radiation pressure on dust grains formed in the stellar atmosphere are generally agreed to play important roles. However, questions persist about the relative importance of different dust species and the dependency of mass loss rates on stellar properties. The article also examines open issues such as asymmetries seen in circumstellar envelopes and comparisons of observed mass loss rates to predictions of theoretical models.

No one set of modelsyet includes all the factors known to be important. In fact, it is verydifficult to construct a model that can simultaneously include these factorsand be useful for computing spectra. Therefore, although theoretical modelgrids are needed to separate the effects of M,L,R and/or $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ orZ on the mass loss rates, these models must be carefully checked againstobservations. Getting the right order of magnitude for the mass loss rate isonly the first step in such a comparison, and is not sufficient to determinewhether the mass loss formula is correct.

Using new spectroscopic observations of the stars in the inner 500 parsecs of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), we study the kinematics, ages, and spatial distributions of the young stellar populations. We identify two distinct populations of young stars--onethat follows typical disk kinematics and another with higher velocity dispersions. Through stellar population modeling, we determine that the high velocity dispersion population has an average age of 100 Myr, suggesting recent in situ star formation. Our findings provide strong evidence that the young stars in the nucleus of M31were formed locally through interaction-triggered gas inflows rather than migration from the outer disk. This study improves our understanding of the processes driving nuclear star formation in large spiral galaxies.",

Traditional risk assessment algorithms often rely on manual feature engineering which can be inefficient and biased. This paper proposes using recursive neural networks for risk assessment to automatically learn representations from raw data. Recursive neural networks are a class of neural network that can handle tree-structured and graph-structured data. The model is applied to two risk assessment problems: credit risk prediction and disease risk prediction using medical records. Results show the recursive neural network approach outperforms traditional algorithms at both tasks, achieving on average 5% higher accuracy. This suggests recursive neural networks are a promising approach for risk assessment problems involving hierarchical or relational data. Overall the model provides an effective and scalable algorithm for risk assessment without relying on manual feature engineering.",

In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach tocompute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processingmodel in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure.Specifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appearin a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acycliclabeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of aninductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursiveneural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised andnon-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclicgraphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through wellpredefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to othersis expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore,the combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalizedmodel of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, asophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first stepfor building future advanced intersection safety systems",

The algorithms aim to efficiently allocate available spectrum among network users, set optimal transmission power levels, determine high throughput routes between nodes, and prevent congestion along network routes. The distributed spectrum allocation algorithm leverages coordination among neighboring nodes to determine non-overlapping channels. The distributed power control scheme iteratively converges on transmit power levels that improve communication links while limiting interference. A distributed routing protocol establishes multiple node-disjoint paths and congestion-aware packet forwarding to balance traffic load. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal throughput while maintaining low complexity for implementation in large-scale networks. Overall, the distributed approaches presented in this work address fundamental problems in wireless networks through localized coordination and information exchange.",
        "human_text": "We develop distributed algorithms to allocate resources in multi-hop wirelessnetworks with the aim of minimizing total cost. In order to observe thefundamental duplexing constraint that co-located transmitters and receiverscannot operate simultaneously on the same frequency band, we first devise aspectrum allocation scheme that divides the whole spectrum into multiplesub-bands and activates conflict-free links on each sub-band. We show that theminimum number of required sub-bands grows asymptotically at a logarithmic ratewith the chromatic number of network connectivity graph. A simple distributedand asynchronous algorithm is developed to feasibly activate links on theavailable sub-bands. Given a feasible spectrum allocation, we then designnode-based distributed algorithms for optimally controlling the transmissionpowers on active links for each sub-band, jointly with traffic routes and userinput rates in response to channel states and traffic demands. We show thatunder specified conditions, the algorithms asymptotically converge to theoptimal operating point.",

Parking is readily available in their adjacent lot. The outdoor patio would be lovely during warmer months. Overall this is a great local gem that deserves its popularity. Ambiance is lively without feeling overly crowded or claustrophobic. Great spot for large groups and families looking for authentic Indian cuisine. Prices are very reasonable given the portion sizes.

From the opening scene you can tell this movie is not taking itself too seriously and is purely meant to be an enjoyable ride. The plot is straightforward but serves as a good vehicle to show off amazing stunts and special effects. Some entertaining cameo appearances add to enjoyment factor. While the storyline is nothing groundbreaking, it moves at a brisk pace and keeps the audience engaged. Fans of the genre will appreciate the nods to classic action films of the past. All the main characters are likeable and charismatic which helps pull audiences into their onscreen adventures. The action sequences are well choreographed and exciting to watch. Even the more over the top unbelievable moments have enough humor and wit to not come across as taking itself too seriously. Both comedy and drama are balanced effectively to give the film mass appeal. Visually it is a treat with impressive cinematography that enhances the excitement.While not high art, as an action romp it delivers what it promises - fun escapism from reality. It knows exactly what kind of film it is and commits to that. Those looking for a mindless but enjoyable way to spend a couple hours will likely be satisfied.

This follow up study focuses specifically on using HI as a tracer to infer properties of the dark matter halo. High-resolution observations of HI emission from Milky Way galaxies provide an excellent tracer of the total gravitational potential as HI is dynamically cold and extended throughout the disk. A 3D HI emission cube of the Milky Way is compiled combining data from existing Milky Way HI surveys to construct the most complete map to date. The HI distribution is analyzed to derive the velocity field as a function of position.A parameterized model for the total gravitational potential is adopted including contributions from baryonic components like stars and gas as well as dark matter. The density profile and mass of the dark matter halo are free parameters which are varied to find the best fit model that reproduces the observed Hi velocity field. Additional constraints from stellar and gas kinematic tracers are also taken into account.The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of the parameter space. The sampling explores a wide range of halo masses, density profiles, and halo shapes. The best fit halo is spherical with a virial mass of 0.8-1.2 ×1012 solar masses and a concentration parameter consistent with expectations from ΛCDM simulations.The analysis finds that the HI rotation curve provides strong independent constraints on the dark matter halo properties.",

Methods. We usedthe Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. The transformation frombrightness temperatures to densities depends on the rotation curve. We exploredseveral models, reflecting different dark matter distributions. Each of thesemodels was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in aself-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. Results.Besides a massive extended halo of M ~ 1.8 10^{12} Msun, we find aself-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 10^{11} Msun, including a darkmatter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 10^{10} Msun. Theexistence of the ring was previously postulated from EGRET data and coincideswith a giant stellar structure that surrounds the Galaxy. The resulting MilkyWay rotation curve is flat up to R~27 kpc and slowly decreases outwards. The\\hi gas layer is strongly flaring. The HWHM scale height is 60 pc at R = 4 kpcand increases to ~2700$ pc at R=40 kpc. Spiral arms cause a noticeable imprinton the gravitational field, at least out to R = 30 kpc. Conclusions. Our massmodel supports previous proposals that the giant stellar ring structure is dueto a merging dwarf galaxy. The fact that the majority of the dark matter in theMilky Way for $R \\la 40$ kpc can be successfully modeled by a self-gravitatingisothermal disk raises the question of whether this massive disk may have beencaused by similar merger events in the past.",

This article explores the self-assembly of an artificial multicellular organism designed to resemble Dictyostelium slime molds through emergent collective behavior. The model uses individual agent-based components that can move and communicate locally with nearby agents. Through simple behavioral rules and local interactions, the agents are able to spontaneously organize into structures and patterns resembling the stages of Dictyostelium development such as aggregation and formation of a migratory slug. Simulation results demonstrate how the agent model can successfully replicate the emergence of cell type specialization and higher-level structures without explicit global coordination or control. This work contributes to understanding the collective dynamics that underlie self-organization in biological systems and has implications for developing other engineered multicellular systems.

In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differentialequation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producingspiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used torepresent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling isfollowed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able toemit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony ofsingle-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ballatop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug.

This leads to an enhanced overall rateof angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at aninteresting rate.

We present a simple modeldemonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergentdisk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretiondisk theory.

A catalog of absorption systems along 100 GRB and 200 QSO sightlines is presented. The rest-frame equivalent widths and velocity spreads of MgII and CIV absorption features are measured and compared between GRB and QSO absorbers. Preliminary results indicate that properties of MgII systems toward QSOs are consistent with previous studies, while more MgII systems with weaker absorption are found associated with GRB afterglows. Further investigation is still needed to understand the differences between GRB and QSO absorber populations and their implications for the gaseous contents and environments of distant galaxies.",

Our CIV sample, consisting of a total of 20systems, is drawn from 3 high resolution and high to moderate S/N VLT/UVESspectra of 3 long-duration GRB afterglows, covering the redshift interval 1.6<z<3.1. The column density distribution and number density of this sample do notshow any statistical difference with the same quantities measured in QSOspectra. We discuss several possibilities for the discrepancy between CIV andMgII absorbers and conclude that a higher dust extinction in the MgII QSOsamples studied up to now would give the most straightforward solution.However, this effect is only important for the strong MgII absorbers.Regardless of the reasons for this discrepancy, this result confirms once morethat GRBs can be used to detect a side of the universe that was unknown before,not necessarily connected with GRBs themselves, providing an alternative andfundamental investigative tool of the cosmic evolution of the universe.",

This study aims to develop accurate yet computationally efficient methods to model peptides. It presents split-valence Gaussian basis sets optimized for the rapid calculation of peptides using restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). The heterolevel approximation is introduced which combines RHF calculations with a smaller basis set and MP2 calculations with a larger basis set, allowing for greater efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Testing on a set of amino acid dimers shows that the developed basis sets with the heterolevel approach achieve close to basis set limit quality energies with significantly lower computational cost than conventional methods. This makes them well-suited for modeling larger peptide systems. Furthermore, equilibrium structures and interaction energies are found to be in good agreement with higher-level calculations. In conclusion, the presented model chemistries provide an favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency for peptides and lay the foundation for future computational studies of biologically significant peptides.",

The basissets used belong to a sample of 39 selected representants from Pople'ssplit-valence families, ranging from the small 3-21G to the large6-311++G(2df,2pd). The reference PES to which the rest are compared is theMP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) homolevel, which, as far as we are aware, is the moreaccurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. The aim of the study presentedis twofold: On the one hand, the evaluation of the influence of polarizationand diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of differentcontraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigationof the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which statesthat heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevelapproximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldomchecked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,have been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the firsttime that this potentially very economical approximation is tested in fullPESs. In order to achieve these goals, all data sets have been compared andanalyzed in a way which captures the nearness concept in the space of MCs.",

The location makes it very convenient for traveling fans to see their team play. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance of the stadium. Game days bring a lot of energy and excitement to the surrounding streets. The public transportation options are excellent, with subways and trains that drop fans off right near the main entrance. The venue itself is modern and spacious, keeping fans comfortable on both hot and cold days. Concessions offer the standard stadium fare along with some local flavor. Perhaps the best feature is the large high-definition video board that hangs above the field. It provides fantastic views of replays and highlights for fans in all areas of the seating bowl. The sight lines are very good from even the highest rows of the upper deck. The field is always in pristine condition and the players seem to enjoy playing on its perfect turf. While the stadium may not have as much character as older venues, it has been well-maintained since opening a decade ago. At the end of games, the staff clears out fans in an orderly and timely manner. The stadium frequently hosts other large events like concerts and shows during the off-season. Overall it provides a great experience for fans of the home team and also visitors from out of town. Upgrades over the years have maintained its status as one of the nicest stadiums in the league.",

She turned to Michael and repeat what she thought she heard Adam say. Michael was equally startled but tried to rationalize it as babies often imitate sounds.In the following weeks, Adam continued saying only \"mechanic\" which left Sarah and Michael puzzled. During his checkup, they asked the pediatrician if it was normal for a child's first word to be a profession. The doctor had never seen anything like it before.

Thecomputed data exhibit only small anomalies in the apparent flexibility of shortDNA and cannot account for the recently reported AFM data (Wiggins et al,Nature nanotechnology 1, 137 (2006)). It is possible that the current atomisticDNA models miss some essential mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate lengthscales. Analysis of bent DNA structures reveals, however, that the bendingmotion is structurally heterogeneous and directionally anisotropic on theintermediate length scales where the experimental anomalies were detected.These effects are essential for interpretation of the experimental data andthey also can be responsible for the apparent discrepancy.",

It defines separability functions on the Hilbert space of density matrices and relates them to Dyson indices which characterize random matrix ensembles. Methods from random matrix theory and quantum information are used to derive explicit expressions for these functions and probabilities in terms of the eigenvalues of the density matrices. The paper finds closed-form solutions for separability functions of two-qubit density matrices and analyzes the separability probabilities both in the Hilbert-Schmidt measure and the Fubini-Study measure. The results yield new insights into the distributions of separable and entangled states and improve understanding of separability properties of quantum states and dynamics.",

We, now, set the separability functionS_{real}(nu) propto B_{nu}(nu,1/2},2) =(2/3) (3-nu) sqrt{nu}. Then, in thecomplex case -- conforming to a pattern we find, manifesting the Dyson indices(1, 2, 4) of random matrix theory-- we take S_{complex}(nu) propto S_{real}^{2}(nu).

However, the debate around whether or not to tip stems from differing views on social and economic responsibilities. While some see tipping as supporting service workers who rely on tips to earn a living wage, others argue gratuity should not be expected nor mandated. Regardless of one's stance, tipping conventionally makes up a significant portion of servers' incomes. A no-tipping policy could threaten their livelihoods unless restaurants increase menu prices or wages accordingly. That said, tip amount should reflect service quality rather than be given automatically as some argue. A percentage-based system also disproportionately benefits those working at pricier establishments.Some propose doing away with tipping culture altogether in favor of higher menu prices and service charges. But changing long-held norms can prove complicated, as may enforcing new pay structures. Tipping also allows diners agency over rewarding exemplary service. And servers themselves are often reluctant to abandon tip income due to higher potential earnings.Overall, reasonable cases exist on both sides of this debate. An ideal solution balancing workers' interests, business viability, and customers' preferences remains elusive. While tipping remains customary, positive change may come through open dialogue that moves past reactions to consider all perspectives compassionately. With community understanding and compromise, fair resolutions supporting all stakeholders can potentially be found.But such complex issues rarely have simple or single answers.",

It aims to clarify some points raised in the commentary regarding the interpretation of experimental data and theoretical analysis presented in the original work. The key issue addressed is regarding the identification of intrinsic properties of a material from artefacts arising due to experimental limitations. The authors re-emphasize that intrinsic tunnelling properties can be reliably extracted from tunnelling spectroscopy measurements by accounting for tunnelling matrix elements and finite temperature effects. Additionally, they argue that the theoretical analysis based on a tight-binding model captures the essential physics and provides valuable insights into the intrinsic electronic structure. Some specific examples are discussed where the interpretations from the original work are validated. In conclusion, the authors believe the main conclusions of the original article on distinguishing intrinsic properties from artefacts remain valid.",

The clerk extracted the memories from the previous owner's brain and transferred them to Jim's. As he viewed the memories in his mind, he saw himself laughing with friends as he opened presents. He also saw his grandmother who had passed away long ago. It felt strange to remember things he knew he had not actually experienced. Not all of his new memories seemed completely accurate to events he later confirmed with family. He wondered how the original memory owners' recollections may have changed over time. After a few days, he noticed the transferred memories starting to fade again. He went back to the store looking to strengthen them but was told repeating the process could damage his brain.

However, recent studies have found that the FGR breaks down at exceptional points where quantum dynamical phase transitions (QDPhTs) occur. In this article, we revisit the validity of the FGR through both analytical and numerical calculations. We demonstrate that QDPhTs emerge as a result of the coalescence of two energy levels and the divergence of transition probabilities. Around exceptional points, transition dynamics become non-adiabatic and deviation from the FGR becomes significant. We further map out the full phase diagram as a function of system parameters and identify distinct quantum dynamical phases. Our work establishes QDPhTs as a new paradigm that supersedes the standard FGR description of quantum transitions.

A non-destructive method for measuring bulk density is needed to gain greater insights into soil health and function over time. This paper presents a novel vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation method for soil bulk density analysis. Vibrations caused randomization of soil particle arrangements which altered the conductivity pathways in the soil. An electromagnetic induction sensor was used to measure the conductivity fluctuations during vibration. Tests were conducted on soil samples with known bulk densities between 1.0 to 1.8 g/cm^3 that were subjected to controlled vibrations. The results showed that conductivity fluctuations increased with higher levels of vibration intensity and inversely correlated with soil bulk density. An empirical correlation was derived between vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation and bulk density that could estimate bulk density with 87% accuracy. The proposed method allows rapid in-field measurement of bulk density without disturbing the soil structure. Further tests on different soil types demonstrated the robustness and consistency of this vibration-based measurement approach. This study suggests vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation has potential for continuous non-destructive monitoring of changes in soil bulk density over time related to factors like compaction or soil remediation activities.",

Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated toquantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future.

The blades werepositioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the inducedvibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized indexwas expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and toreduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment wasconducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions andfour bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soilcontact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurementnoise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that thetransversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of drysand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivityfluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversalsettings. The decrease in the transversal signal was smaller than expected. Thewet natural and salinized soils performed very similarly as hypothesized, buttheir normalized VICOF response was not significant to bulk density changes.",

However, measuring quiet Sun magnetic fields from the Earth's surface has proven challenging due to atmospheric interference. This article aims to simulate observations of quiet Sun magnetic fields from the Hinode space observatory in order to better characterize these weak fields. The authors create simulated polarization maps using a 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic model of the quiet solar photosphere and chromosphere. Various observational effects expected for the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope such as stray light and instrumental cross-talk are included in the simulations. The results demonstrate Hinode's capability to detect weak magnetic features down to 100 gauss, helping to provide a more complete picture of quiet Sun magnetism and its role in solar variability.",

However, the molecular and cellular processes supporting the long-term maintenance of established LTP and memories remain unclear. Here we introduce a novel computational model of late LTP (L-LTP) aimed at simulating key aspects of memory maintenance at the synaptic level. The model incorporates molecular components and interactions known to be crucial for both L-LTP expression and the stable maintenance of elevated synaptic strength over time. Simulation results demonstrate the model's ability to sustain LTP and mimic experimental observations of L-LTP decay dynamics over periods of hours and days in vitro. The simulations provide new insight into how positive feedback loops among transcription, translation, and synaptic tagging/capture mechanisms act in concert to stabilize enhanced synaptic transmission underlying memory traces. Furthermore, the model predicts testable hypotheses about how internal and external perturbations may disrupt stable L-LTP expression and cause forgetting over extended timescales. Overall, this computational investigation of L-LTP presents a framework for exploring memory maintenance at the synaptic level and generating novel hypotheses regarding the fragility and persistence of established memories in the brain.",

Ongoing recurrent neuronalactivity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized topreferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesishas not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representingbiochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity intotwo such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essentialbiochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced modelrepresents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailedmodel adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeledas continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states ofsynaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and theamplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic ortheta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a highweight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parametervariations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity resetsynapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,episodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.Both models support experimental predictions.

Unfortunately, neither dish came with any cheese, which was really disappointing. The salad tasted fine but was lacking without parmesan to top it off. The pasta was rather bland without any cream sauce or sprinkling of shredded mozzarella.

I'm used to most pasta dishes including at least a sprinkle of parmesan, if not another cheese. We ended up asking for small side portions of cheese to add ourselves, but felt we should not have to ask and pay extra for a basic ingredient.

This article presents an analysis of the consistency for the case of the chiral pion production operator. Perturbative calculations at one loop reveal anomalous dimensions that scale as predicted by naive dimensional analysis and the effective field theory approach. However, higher-loop contributions may violate these expectations. The renormalization group evolution of the chiral pion production operator is studied using explicit calculations in dimensional regularization up to two loops in perturbative QCD. The results demonstrate consistency between the anomalous dimension and the expected scaling from quark-hadron duality at both one and two loops. This consistency supports applying renormalization group improvement to extend the domain of applicability of quark-hadron duality to higher scales. However, nonperturbative contributions not encoded in the anomalous dimension may still invalidate duality at higher energies. Overall, the findings provide evidence that renormalization group methods can be combined with quark-hadron duality to understand chiral hadronic dynamics over a wider range of scales.",

However, the kinematics and dynamics of the thinnest filaments had not previously been characterized due to observational limitations. We present the first proper motion measurements of eight thin dust filaments within one parsec of Sagittarius A*, the massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Using near-infrared imaging data spanning 18 years from multiple telescopes, we are able to track the motions of these filaments with unprecedented precision. Our analysis finds that seven of the eight filaments exhibit significant proper motions perpendicular to their long axes, with velocities ranging from 25 to 120 km/s. We compare the observed kinematics to various proposed formation mechanisms for the dust structures. The most consistent scenario is that these filaments were stretched from clumps of gas by shearing from Galactic Center winds or the gravitational potential of orbiting molecular clouds. This has implications for the origin and fate of diffuse interstellar material within the harsh central environment. Going forward, continued monitoring of the filaments' motions will help constrain dynamical models of gas flows and tidal forces in this region. The proper motion measurements also provide a new way to identify embedded young stellar objects and study triggered star formation around Sagittarius A*.

Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements ofthe thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* andinvestigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observedmotions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACOadaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to acommon coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then across-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine theoffsets between the features with respect to their position in the referenceepoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that theshape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerianmotion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at theposition of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible fortheir formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments areprobably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars aroundSgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself.

Good, but a smallish portion, and nothing really special about it. The shoulder was excellent, and rivaled a tender pot roast. The risotto was good, as was the berry that highlighted the plate.

Well, our server didn't really seem to notice that other people at the table might want some dessert, and was almost shocked when two of us asked for dessert menus when the cakes started arriving. nnAn order of ice cream and another of berries went completely unserved, though we waited twenty minutes or so for them.",

The skirling of their drones announced their charge across no man's land. The opposing battalion wavered at the unexpected assault of sound. Suddenly, a stirring rendition of \"Scotland the Brave\" urged the men forward. Slowly but surely, yards of terrain were gained with each powerful portrayal of patriotic pipe tunes. Back and forth the tide of battle turned, carried by crests of energizing airs and marches. As dusk fell, the Glockenspiel troops began to retreat in defeat. Their tinkling melodies no match for the 101st's heart-stirring repertoire. \"One more song lads, sing them into the hills!\" cried Colonel McClaren. A rousing finale of \"Flower of Scotland\" scattered the remnants of the division.The enemy commander was forced to surrender, their spirits shaken by the Scottish warriors and their mighty bagpipes.

Prosecutors claim the teacher, aged 35, began messaging the 16 year old boy on social media and their communications became sexual in nature over a period of months. In messages shown to the court, the teacher declared her love for the student and said she believed they were \"meant to be together\". However, the student has since accused the teacher of taking advantage of him for her own gratification. If found guilty, the teacher risks losing her job and career as well as facing imprisonment. The school, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stressed they have a zero tolerance policy for such inappropriate behavior and moved quickly to suspend her once allegations surfaced. The teacher pleaded not guilty to the charges, arguing the contact was consensual and she had not abused her position of trust. During cross-examination, the student said he had initially felt flattered by the attention from his teacher but quickly became uncomfortable with the situation.

This study examines the disordering transition and peak effect phenomenon in systems of varied particle sizes using computer simulations. Systems with a wide range of particle sizes were modeled to undergo melting or solidification over a range of temperatures. The results show an irregular disordering process with spatial heterogeneities that persist longer for wider particle size distributions. An increased probability of defects such as dislocation pairs was also found near melting temperatures for polydisperse systems. Most notably, an amplified peak effect in the dynamic properties prior to transition was observed for systems with a broader size distribution. These findings provide novel understanding of how variable particle properties affect transitional behaviors in condensed matter. Further experiments are still needed to validate these computational observations.",

If the quenched disorder is strongenough to create a significant amount of topological disorder in themonodisperse system, addition of a poorly pinned species generates furtherdisorder but does not produce a peak in the depinning force. Our resultsindicate that for binary mixtures, optimal pinning occurs for topologicaldefect fraction densities of 0.2 to 0.25. For defect densities below thisrange, the system retains orientational order. We determine the effect of thepinning density, strength, and radius on the depinning peak and find that thepeak effect is more pronounced in weakly pinning systems.",

The authors develop an algorithm to compute geodesics exactly for spin chains of any length.

As king of the gods, his power was unmatched on Olympus or in any of the lands below. Yet a darkness had begun to stir in his heart, a restlessness with the endless parties and intrigues of immortal life. A new diversion was needed to appease the lord of the skies. And so it was that with a flash of lightning and a roar of thunder, Zeus took on a new form and descended to Earth to walk among mortals once more. Among the hills of Arcadia, a beautiful nymph named Europa caught his eye. \"Come with me,\" the handsome traveler said, extending a hand. Europa accepted, unaware of the divine power before her. Their love affair played out for many passionate nights. But as all such dalliances must, it too reached its end when Zeus' true nature was finally revealed in a burst of celestial light. Though Europa begged to stay, duty called the god back to his heavenly throne.",

One of the stories is about the great empire of Tonatefor whose people tried to worship both the Good One and the Evil One, depending of what was the best in the moment. That lead to the destruction of Tonatefor at the hands of the Evil One, because the Good One had abandoned them, for their treachery and evil ways.",

We examine the action of these operators on Fock space and study properties of the corresponding number operator.

[assistant]: The abstract of the academic article \"Dark Matter in Gauge Mediation from Emergent Supersymmetry\" could be as following:Gauge mediation is a well-motivated mechanism to transmit supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector. However, in most models, gauge mediation suffers from the little hierarchy problem: the messenger fields which mediate the interactions between the supersymmetry breaking sector and the observable sector tend to acquire large masses due to supersymmetry breaking effects. This can lead to unnaturally large contributions to the Higgs mass. In this paper, we propose a solution to the little hierarchy problem in gauge mediation using emergent supersymmetry. Emergent supersymmetry is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking which relies on the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. In our model, the messenger fields are charged under a hidden gauge group which is strongly coupled at the messenger mass scale. The strong dynamics of the hidden gauge group generate a large anomalous dimension for the messenger fields, which suppresses their masses. This allows us to solve the little hierarchy problem and obtain a naturally light Higgs mass. We also discuss the phenomenological implications of our model, including the dark matter candidate and the collider signatures.",
        "human_text": "We investigated the viability of neutralino dark matter in the gaugemediation from emergent supersymmetry proposal. In this proposal, supersymmetryis broken at Planck scale and consequently, the gravitino is superheavy andcompletely decouples from the low energy theory. Squarks and sleptons obtaintheir soft masses dominantly through gauge mediation with other mechanismshighly suppressed. The lightest supersymmetric partner, in contrast totraditional gauge mediation, is a neutralino which is also a dark mattercandidate. By explicit calculation of the low energy spectra, the parameterspace was constrained using the WMAP observed relic density of dark matter,LEP2 Higgs mass bounds, collider bounds on supersymmetric partners and exoticB-meson decays. We found that the model has intriguing hybrid features such asa nearly gauge-mediated spectrum (the exception being the superheavy gravitino)but with a dominant mSUGRA-like bino-stau coannihilation channel and at large$\\tan \\beta$, A-resonance-like annihilation.",

The primary goal of this project is to model the merger of magnetized neutron stars following their formation in the core collapse of massive stars. Our Godunov-type MHD solver is designed to handle strong shocks, large density and pressure contrasts, and magnetic fields. The integration of the ordinary differential equations is performed using a third-order Runge-Kutta scheme. The code uses a cell-centered finite-volume scheme to solve the MHD equations. The spatial reconstruction of the variables is based on the piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is used to locally increase the resolution where needed, reducing the computational cost. We describe the numerical methods employed, and discuss the results of a number of one-, two-, and three-dimensional tests. The one- and two-dimensional tests include shock tube problems, the collapse of a magnetized cylinder, the Sedov blast wave, and the Parker instability. These results demonstrate that the code performs well and is capable of accurately capturing the dynamics of MHD flows. Three-dimensional tests of the AMR algorithm are also presented, and we show that significant computational savings can be achieved by using AMR for problems with large spatial dynamic range.",

The evolution of the magnetic field is formulated interms of so-called Euler potentials which are advected with the fluid and thusguarantee the MHD flux-freezing condition. This formulation is equivalent to avector potential approach and therefore fulfills the$\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{B}=0$-constraint by construction. Extensive tests inone, two and three dimensions are presented.

It is shown that under typical conditions, as they are also present inexperiments, only a rather weak stretching of the side chains is realized, andthen the scaling predictions based on the extension of the Daoud-Cotton blobpicture are not applicable. Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types(A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kindrepel each other. In this case, variable solvent quality is allowed for, suchthat for poor solvent conditions rather dense cylinder-like structures result.Theories predict ``Janus Cylinder''-type phase separation along the backbone inthis case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluthmethod (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length.Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-richpart of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally. Thecorrelation length of this microphase separation can be controlled by thesolvent quality. This lack of a phase transition is interpreted by an analogywith models for ferromagnets in one space dimension.",

The films were fabricated using pulsed laser deposition, and their thickness was controlled by the number of deposited pulses. The transport properties of the films were measured using a four-probe technique. The results showed that the films exhibited a metal-insulator transition at a temperature of around 250 K. The resistivity of the films was found to decrease with increasing film thickness. The Hall coefficient of the films was found to be positive, indicating that the films are n-type semiconductors. The magnetoresistance of the films was found to be negative, indicating that the films exhibit ferromagnetic behavior.",

However, a brief oxygenplasma etch allows full recovery of the insulating character of the substrate.The I-V characteristics of the bridges are then fully linear over a large rangeof current densities. We find colossal magnetoresistance properties typical forstrained LCMO on STO but no signature of non-linear effects (so-calledelectroresistance) connected to electronic inhomogeneites. In the metallicstate below 150 K, the highest current densities lead to heating effects andnon-linear I-V characteristics.",

In this work, we study the X-ray emissions from such accretion flows in the dipole magnetic field, considering the thermal and non-thermal processes simultaneously. We find that the thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the accreting matter and the synchrotron emission from the secondary pairs dominate the spectra. The radiation pressure plays an important role in the accretion dynamics. Our calculations show that, under some conditions, the radiation force can significantly reduce the accretion luminosity and even blow away the accretion flow, leading to an effective suppression of the radiation. The dependences of the spectral and timing properties on the viewing angle and the magnetic field strength are investigated. The comparisons with the typical properties of several X-ray sources suggest that our model can be applied to some observed sources.",

We consider situations in which the electronsand ions in the flow cannot maintain thermal equilibrium (two-temperatureeffects) due to strong radiative loss, and determine the effects on the keVX-ray properties of the systems. We apply this model to investigate theaccretion shocks of white dwarfs in magnetic cataclysmic variables. We havefound that the incorporation of two-temperature effects could harden the keVX-rays. Also, the dipolar model yields harder X-ray spectra than the standardplanar model if white dwarf is sufficiently massive (>~1M_sun). When fittingobserved keV X-ray spectra of magnetic cataclysmic variables, the inclusion oftwo-temperature hydrodynamics and a dipolar accretion geometry lowers estimatesfor white-dwarf masses when compared with masses inferred from models excludingthese effects. We find mass reductions <~9% in the most massive cases.",

The sample consists of 24 barred and 18 non-barred galaxies. The synthesized beam size is 15\\arcsec\\ (300 pc at the distance of M31). All the galaxies are detected in CO emission, except for two galaxies with a high inclination angle (\\textgreater60\\arcdeg). The CO intensity-weighted mean velocity and velocity dispersion are measured for each galaxy. We investigate the differences in the global CO properties between barred and non-barred galaxies. The barred galaxies tend to have lower CO velocity dispersions compared with the non-barred galaxies. We find that barred galaxies show a variety of distributions of molecular gas. About 20% of the barred galaxies show the concentration of molecular gas toward the center, while the others do not show such concentration. About 40% of the barred galaxies show the enhancement of molecular gas in the bar region. We also examine the spatial distribution of the peak CO intensity in each galaxy. Most of the galaxies show a peak in the central region, however, about 20% of the galaxies show an off-center peak. There is no difference in the fraction of off-center peaks between barred and non-barred galaxies.

The maps of CO cover most of the optical disk of the galaxies. Weinvestigated the influence of bar on the distribution of molecular gas inspiral galaxies using these data. We confirmed that the degree of centralconcentration is higher in barred spirals than in non-barred spirals as shownby the previous works. Furthermore, we present an observational evidence thatbars are efficient in driving molecular gas that lies within the bar lengthtoward the center, while the role in bringing gas in from the outer parts ofthe disks is small. The transported gas accounts for about half of moleculargas within the central region in barred spiral galaxies. We found a correlationbetween the degree of central concentration and bar strength. Galaxies withstronger bars tend to have higher central concentration. The correlationimplies that stronger bars accumulate molecular gas toward the center moreefficiently.

The structure of the internetwork has been extensively studied in the past with instruments of limited spatial resolution and/or narrow frequency coverage. With the advent of new instruments such as the Atacama Large (Sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA), the Submillimeter Array (SMA), and the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA), a new window has opened into the study of the quiet Sun at high spatial resolution and with full frequency coverage in the millimeter/sub-millimeter regime. In this paper, we present a study of the internetwork emission in the 1.3 mm continuum with ALMA at 0.″3 resolution. Using these data, together with additional data from the SMA and the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 1.3, 2.0, 3.5, 9.0, and 17.0 mm, we investigate the physical properties of the internetwork. We find that the brightness temperature of the quiet Sun at 1.3 mm is 13,000 ± 1000 K. We find that the emission at 1.3 mm is dominated by thermal dust emission and that the contribution from free–free emission and gyrosynchrotron emission is small. Our results suggest that magnetic fields in the internetwork are weak (∼10–50 G). We compare our results with previous studies of the quiet Sun at millimeter wavelengths and discuss the implications for coronal heating.",

Future high-resolution millimetre arrays, suchas the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), will thus produce valuable inputfor the ongoing controversy on the thermal structure and the dynamics of thislayer. Synthetic brightness temperature maps are calculated on basis ofthree-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. While themillimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, thelonger wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. Theeffective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also fromdisk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contributionfunctions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are evendouble-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and coolpost-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account thedeviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strongvariation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The resultis a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperatureincreases with wavelength and towards the limb. The relative contrast dependson wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towardsthe limb. The dependence of the brightness temperature distribution onwavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formationheight and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the modelatmospheres.",

We measured radial velocities for 53 cluster member candidates and derived a mean radial velocity of −47.4 ± 0.6 km s−1 and a velocity dispersion of 2.2 ± 0.4 km s−1. The metallicity of the cluster was estimated using the [Fe/H] abundance ratio, yielding a value of −0.26 ± 0.06 dex. We also determined the cluster's reddening, E(B − V) = 0.09 ± 0.02 mag, and distance, 1.82 ± 0.09 kpc.

The aim is to derive the cluster membership,velocity and metallicity, and discuss recent claims in the literature (Tadross2005) that NGC 1883 is as metal poor as globular clusters in the Halo. Besides,being one of the few outer Galactic disk intermediate-age open clusters knownso far, it is an ideal target to improve our knowledge of the Galactic diskradial abundance gradient, that is a basic ingredient for any chemicalevolution model of the Milky Way. The new data we obtained allow us to put NGC1883's basic parameters more reliable. We find that the cluster has a meanmetallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.20$\\pm$0.22, from which we infer an age(650$^{+70}_{-70}$ Myr) close to the Hyades one and a Galactocentric distanceof 12.3$^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ kpc. The metal abundance, kinematics, and position makeNGC 1883 a genuine outer disk intermediate-age open cluster.

The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the water was very hot. The chairs are old and not very effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not do this, but she did punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though.",

        "direct_prompt": "Sure, here's a story based on the writing prompt:In a world grappling with viral threats, a groundbreaking antiviral drug emerged, promising to revolutionize healthcare. Unlike traditional vaccines that targeted the unique traits of each virus, this new drug aimed at the common aspects shared by all viruses. The scientific community celebrated the potential to combat a wide range of infections with a single treatment.However, as the drug was introduced and administered to patients, unexpected consequences unfolded. Instead of selectively targeting viruses, the drug's indiscriminate nature disrupted essential cellular processes, leading to severe side effects. Healthy cells were mistakenly identified as viral entities, resulting in widespread damage to the immune system and vital organs.Governments and health organizations scrambled to contain the escalating crisis as reports of fatalities and debilitating conditions poured in. The once-promising drug turned into a nightmare, leaving healthcare systems overwhelmed and struggling to provide care for the affected individuals.Amidst the chaos, a team of dedicated scientists embarked on a race against time to unravel the intricacies of the drug's adverse effects. Collaborating tirelessly, they discovered that the drug's broad targeting mechanism inadvertently triggered an autoimmune response, mistaking the body's own cells for foreign invaders.As the scale of the catastrophe became evident, public trust in scientific advancements wavered. The pursuit of a universal solution had inadvertently unleashed a devastating blow to global health. Nations implemented stringent regulations and reevaluated their approach to antiviral treatments, emphasizing the need for targeted and cautious interventions.The story serves as a stark reminder that while scientific progress holds immense promise, unintended consequences can arise from seemingly ingenious solutions.",

The films were deposited at different pO2 ranging from 10−6 to 10−2 Torr, and their properties were characterized using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, and Hall effect measurements. The results showed that the films exhibited a single-phase rutile structure with a (110) preferred orientation. The lattice parameters and the grain size of the films increased with increasing pO2. The films were found to be ferromagnetic at room temperature, and the magnetic moment increased with increasing pO2. The electrical resistivity of the films decreased with increasing pO2, and the films exhibited a semiconducting behavior. The results of this study suggest that the oxygen partial pressure plays an important role in determining the structural, transport, and magnetic properties of Co-doped TiO2 films.",

In this paper, we report the observation of Landau levels of Dirac fermions in graphite, which are a consequence of the unique electronic structure of graphene. We measured the electrical conductivity of graphite as a function of magnetic field and temperature, and observed a series of Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations. These oscillations are a consequence of the quantization of the energy levels of Dirac fermions in a magnetic field, and provide a direct measurement of the Fermi velocity of graphene. Our results are in good agreement with the predictions of the Dirac fermion model of graphene.",

Younger girl working behind the counter seemed apathetic to be there. All in all, I'd pass on this store.

In particular, charge order, in which the charge distribution exhibits a regular pattern, is often considered as a precursor to superconductivity. The interplay between charge order and lattice distortion, known as electron-lattice coupling, is crucial to understanding the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. In this paper, we investigate the effects of electron-lattice coupling on charge order in $\\theta$-(ET)$_2$X, a quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor. We use a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements to show that the electron-lattice coupling leads to a significant enhancement of the charge order and a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature. Our results provide new insights into the role of electron-lattice coupling in unconventional superconductors.",

The X-ray emission is thought to be produced by thermal emission from hot plasma and non-thermal emission from cosmic rays.The relative contribution of these two components is still a matter of debate. In this work, we perform a differential absorption/emission analysis of the GC diffuse X-ray emission using Suzaku observations. We find that the non-thermal emission dominates the GC diffuse X-ray emission in the inner region (r < 50 pc), while the thermal emission becomes more significant in the outer region (r > 50 pc).

Here wereport a comparative X-ray emission and absorption study of diffuse hot gasalong the sight lines toward 3C 273 and Mrk 421, on and off the enhancement,but at similar Galactic latitudes. The diffuse 3/4-keV emission intensity, asestimated from the ROSAT All Sky Survey, is about three times higher toward 3C273 than toward Mrk 421.

This paper presents the results of a case study conducted at Harz University, which explored the use of the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework for process optimisation in the IT Service Centre. The study focused on the Release Management process, which is critical for ensuring the smooth and timely delivery of new IT services. The findings of the study revealed that the implementation of ITIL best practices, such as the establishment of a clear and documented process, the use of standardised templates, and the involvement of key stakeholders, significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the Release Management process. The paper concludes that ITIL provides a valuable framework for process optimisation in the IT Service Centre of higher education institutions.",

It is also shown, how the ITIL framework fits into thefour-layered-process model, that could be derived from interviews with theuniversities IT support staff, and how the various modified processesinterconnect with each other to form a value chain. The paper highlights thefinal results of the project and gives an outlook on the future use of ITIL asa business modelling tool in the IT Service Centre of Harz University.

We analyze the security of the proposed scheme and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations.

We consider a general class of LDR processes, including fractional Brownian motion and fractional Gaussian noise, and derive their asymptotic distributions under various conditions. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the limiting behavior of duration-driven LDR processes, which can be useful in a variety of applications, such as telecommunications, queuing theory, and finance.Specifically, we first establish the weak convergence of duration-driven LDR processes to a Gaussian process. We then derive the exact form of the limiting Gaussian process and characterize its properties. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the sample mean and sample variance of duration-driven LDR processes and obtain their limiting distributions. Our results are derived using a combination of techniques from probability theory and functional analysis.",

For these processes, we obtain thelimiting distribution of suitably standardized discrete Fourier transforms(DFTs) and sample autocovariances. At low frequencies, the standardized DFTsconverge to a stable law, as do the standardized sample autocovariances atfixed lags. Finite collections of standardized sample autocovariances at afixed set of lags converge to a degenerate distribution. The standardized DFTsat high frequencies converge to a Gaussian law.

This approach allows us to resolve the ultraviolet divergences that plague traditional approaches to quantum field theory and to provide a rigorous foundation for the Heisenberg-Pauli interpretation of quantum mechanics.We begin by introducing the concept of a nonlinear generalized function and discuss its properties. We then show how nonlinear generalized functions can be used to construct a new formulation of quantum field theory that is free of ultraviolet divergences. Finally, we discuss the implications of our new approach for the Heisenberg-Pauli interpretation of quantum mechanics.Our new approach to the foundations of quantum field theory provides a number of advantages over traditional approaches. First, it is free of ultraviolet divergences. Second, it provides a rigorous foundation for the Heisenberg-Pauli interpretation of quantum mechanics. Third, it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of quantum fields in a variety of physical situations.We believe that our new approach to the foundations of quantum field theory has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.",
        "human_text": "In 1929 Heisenberg and Pauli laid the foundations of QFT by quantizing thefields (method of canonical quantization). This general theory of quantizedfields has remained undisputed up to now. We show how the unmodifiedHeisenberg-Pauli calculations make sense mathematically by using a theory ofgeneralized functions adapted to nonlinear operations. By providing anappropriate mathematical setting, nonlinear generalized functions open doorsfor their understanding but there remains presumably very hard technicalproblems. (i) Domains of the interacting field operators: a priori the H-Pcalculations give time dependent dense domains, what is not very convenient;(ii) Calculations of the resulting matrix elements of the S operator: from theunitarity of the S operator as a whole there are no longer ``infinities,'' buta priori there is no other hope than heavy computer calculations; (iii)Connection with renormalization theory: it should provide an approximation whenthe coupling constant is small. The aim of this paper is to present, on thegrounds of a standard mathematical model of QFT (a self interacting scalarboson field), a basis for improvement without significant prerequisites inmathematics and physics. It is an attempt to use nonlinear generalizedfunctions in QFT, starting directly from the calculations made by physicists,in the same way as they have already been used in classical mechanics andgeneral relativity.",

The colors and metallicities of GCLs are sensitive to the star formation histories of their host galaxies. In this paper, we present new optical and near-infrared photometry of 18 GCLs in eight massive early-type galaxies. We derive accurate structural parameters, colors, and metallicities for these clusters. Using these new data, we examine the relationships between GCL colors, metallicities, and the masses of their host galaxies. We find that the peak colors and metallicities of GCLs increase with increasing host galaxy mass. This suggests that more massive galaxies formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than less massive galaxies. We also find that the slopes of the color–metallicity relations of GCLs are steeper in more massive galaxies. This indicates that the star formation histories of more massive galaxies were more strongly regulated by feedback processes. Our results provide new insights into the formation and evolution of GCLs and their host galaxies.",

While direct estimates ofthe ages of MRGC populations neither can rule out nor reliably support thepopulations' age trend, key data on timing of the formation of spheroids andother indirect evidence imply it in the sense: the more massive spheroid theolder on average its MRGC population. We show that the contribution of anallowable age trend of the MRGC populations to their peak color trend canachieve up to ~50 % or so. In this event the comparable value of the colortrend, ~30 %, is due to alpha-element ratio systematic variations of the orderof Delta[alpha/Fe] ~ 0.1 to 0.2 dex because of a correlation between the[alpha/Fe] ratios and age. Hence a systematic variation of exactly [Fe/H]ratios may turn out to be less significant among the contributors, and itsrange many times lower, i.e. of the order of Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.1 or even none,than the corresponding range deduced by assuming no age trend.",

The library is based on stellar population synthesis models and takes into account the effects of dust extinction and nebular emission. We use the library to classify and parametrize a sample of unresolved galaxies observed by the Gaia satellite. We find that the majority of the galaxies in our sample are star-forming galaxies with a relatively young stellar population. We also find a small number of galaxies that are either passive or have a very old stellar population.

Results:We produce a basic libraryof about 4000 zero redshift galaxy spectra covering the main Hubble types overwavelength range 250 to 1050 nm at a sampling of 1 nm or less. It is computedon a regular grid of four key astrophysical parameters for each type and forintermediate random values of the same parameters. An extended libraryreproduces this at a series of redshifts. Initial results from the SVMclassifiers and parametrizers are promising, indicating that Hubble types canbe reliably predicted and several parameters estimated with low bias andvariance.

These waveforms provide a more accurate description of the dynamics of small-mass-ratio systems than previous Effective-One-Body waveforms, particularly for quasicircular binaries. We validate SEOBNRv4HM waveforms by comparing them with numerical relativity simulations and show that they provide excellent agreement. We also study the convergence of our waveforms with respect to the number of harmonics used in their construction and find that a minimum of four harmonics is required to obtain accurate results.We publicly release our SEOBNRv4HM waveforms through the Black Hole Initial Data Bank.

The present paper focuses on small-mass-rationon-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied byRegge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed,3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description ofradiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression forthe plunge waveform, (iv) an improved treatment of the matching between theplunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOBapproach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit aremarkable agreement with the ``exact'' ones in modulus, frequency and phase.In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during thewhole process, within $\\pm 1.1 %$ of a cycle.

The lens models are constructed by fitting the observed lensed images, and the best model is selected based on the Bayesian evidence. Using the best-fit lens model, we find that the total mass within the effective radius of the main lens galaxy is (\\(9.24_{-0.90}^{+0.95}\\times10^{11}\\)) \\(\\text{M}_\\odot\\), which is consistent with the stellar mass estimated from the spectral energy distribution fitting. We also identify two counter-images of a lensed background source, and find that the flux ratios of the two counter-images are consistent with our best-fit lens model. By performing a detailed comparison between the observed images and the model predictions, we show that the lensing model can reproduce the observed features very well.

The dark matter halo has aninner slope of 1.42+/-0.23, consistent with CDM simulations after allowing forbaryon contraction. The baryonic component has a B-band mass-to-light ratio of1.71+0.28-0.38 (solar units) which when evolved to the present day is inagreement with local ellipticals. Within the Einstein radius of 0.77'' (5.6kpc), the baryons account for (46+/-11)% of the total lens mass. External shearfrom a nearby foreground cluster is accurately predicted by the model.

[assistant]: Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to generate Crab giant pulses (GPs) in the framework of the outer gap model. The model is based on the assumption that GPs are produced by a two-step process: (1) a small-scale primary instability develops in the pulsar magnetosphere, leading to the formation of a pair-starved gap; (2) the primary instability triggers a large-scale secondary instability, which results in the generation of a GP. The model is applied to the Crab pulsar, and the results are compared with the observed properties of Crab GPs. We find that the model can successfully reproduce the main features of Crab GPs, including their luminosity, duration, and spectral properties. The model also provides a new insight into the physical mechanism responsible for the generation of Crab GPs.",

Waves are generated in a set of fine, unequally spaced, narrow emissionbands at frequencies much lower than a local cyclotron frequency.

To reproduce the data, the required density of plasma in the giant pulsesemission region is much higher, by a factor $\\sim 3 \\times 10^5$, than theminimal Goldreich-Julian density. Emission is generated by a population ofhighly energetic particles with radiation-limited Lorentz factors $\\gamma \\sim7 \\times 10^7$, produced during occasional reconnection close to the Y point,where the last closed field lines approach the light cylinder.",

The soft X-ray band (0.5-2 keV) is a key energy range for studying black hole mass in AGN, as it is dominated by the thermal emission from the accretion disk. In this work, we present a new method for estimating black hole mass from soft X-ray spectra, based on the measurement of the flux and spectral slope of the soft X-ray excess. We apply our method to a sample of 100 AGN with high-quality X-ray data, and find that our estimates are consistent with those obtained from other methods. We also investigate the relationship between black hole mass and other AGN properties, such as luminosity and Eddington ratio. Our results provide new insights into the growth and evolution of black holes in AGN.",

Suitable corrections have to be introduced when theaccretion rate approaches or exceeds the Eddington limit. We summarizephenomenological models that can explain the very high state, with apparentlyhigher disk temperatures and lower inner-disk radii. Conversely, ultraluminousX-ray sources often contain cooler disks with large characteristic radii. Weintroduce another phenomenological model for this accretion state. We arguethat a standard disk dominates the radiative output for radii larger than acharacteristic transition radius R_c ~ mdot x R_{ISCO}, where mdot is theaccretion rate in Eddington units and R_{ISCO} is the innermost stable orbit.For R_{ISCO} < R < R_c, most of the accretion power is released via non-thermalprocesses. We predict the location of such sources in a luminosity-temperatureplot. We conclude that black holes with masses ~ 50-100 Msun accreting at mdot~ 10-20 may explain the X-ray properties of many ULXs.",

However, measuring interfacial tensions accurately is difficult. We present a new method to calculate interfacial tensions between coexisting phases from computer simulations. Unlike previous simulation methods, our approach does not require the free energy of the system to be calculated, and is therefore much more efficient. We have implemented our method for a model system of freely jointed tangent hard sphere chains, and show that it provides accurate results for interfacial tensions over a range of temperatures. We believe that this method has potential to be widely applied to the calculation of interfacial tensions in complex fluids, including systems where it is difficult to determine the free energy.",

The proposed algorithm is comparedwith known results for the surface tension of Lennard--Jones and Square Wellfluid, as well as for the interface tension of a bead--spring polymer model andgood agreement is found. We also calculate interfacial tensions of freelyjointed tangent hard sphere chains on athermal walls for a wide range of chainlengths and densities. The results are compared with three differenttheoretical approaches, Scaled Particle Theory, the Yu and Wu densityfunctional theory and an analytical approximation based on the latter approach.Whereas SPT only yields qualitative results, the last two approaches are foundto yield very good agreement with simulations.",

We present the results of multi-wavelength observations of PGC 045080, including new radio continuum and H I observations, as well as archival optical and infrared data. The radio continuum emission is dominated by the nuclear region, which hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The H I disk extends to a radius of 15 kpc, and shows a regular rotation curve. The AGN is fueling an outflow of gas, which is traced by the H I absorption and the X-ray emission. The outflow is likely responsible for the low surface brightness of the galaxy, as it is removing gas from the disk and preventing it from forming stars. We estimate the star formation rate of PGC 045080 to be 0.1 Msun/yr, which is consistent with the low surface brightness of the galaxy. The AGN in PGC 045080 is a Seyfert 2 galaxy, and it is the main source of ionization for the H II regions in the galaxy. The H II regions are distributed throughout the disk of the galaxy, and they are likely formed by the interaction of the AGN outflow with the disk gas. PGC 045080 is a nearby, low surface brightness galaxy that is an ideal target for studying the interaction between AGN and their host galaxies.",

PGC 045080 is amoderately distant galaxy having a highly inclined optical disk and massive HIgas content. Radio continuum observations of the galaxy were carried out at 320MHz, 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Continuum emission was detected and mapped in thegalaxy. The emission appears extended over the inner disk at all threefrequencies. At 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz it appears to have two distinct lobes. Wealso did optical spectroscopy of the galaxy nucleus; the spectrum did not showany strong emission lines associated with AGN activity but the presence of aweak AGN cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, comparison of the H$\\alpha$ flux andradio continuum at 1.4 GHz suggests that a significant fraction of the emissionis non-thermal in nature. Hence we conclude that a weak or hidden AGN may bepresent in PGC 045080. The extended radio emission represents lobes/jets fromthe AGN. These observations show that although LSB galaxies are metal poor andhave very little star formation, their centers can host significant AGNactivity. We also mapped the HI gas disk and velocity field in PGC 045080. TheHI disk extends well beyond the optical disk and appears warped. In the HIintensity maps, the disk appears distinctly lopsided. The velocity field isdisturbed on the lopsided side of the disk but is fairly uniform in the otherhalf. We derived the HI rotation curve for the galaxy from the velocity field.The rotation curve has a flat rotation speed of ~ 190 km/s.",

Igeneralize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables,non-detections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampleris described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution ofthe parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the methodwith other common estimators. The simulations illustrate that the Gaussianmixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively giveconstraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errorsdominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or theintrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture ofGaussians. I conclude by using this method to fit the X-ray spectral slope as afunction of Eddington ratio using a sample of 39 z < 0.8 radio-quiet quasars. Iconfirm the correlation seen by other authors between the radio-quiet quasarX-ray spectral slope and the Eddington ratio, where the X-ray spectral slopesoftens as the Eddington ratio increases.",

Radiative transfer fits of V and K'-band imagesWe present a study of the dust distribution in edge-on galaxies using radiative transfer fits of V and K'-band images. The sample consists of 12 nearby galaxies with a wide range of morphological types. We use a two-dimensional dust distribution model to fit the observed images, and we derive the dust opacity, scale height, and asymmetry. We find that the dust opacity is typically higher in the inner regions of the galaxies, and that the scale height increases with radius. The dust distribution is also found to be asymmetric in most of the galaxies, with the dust lane being shifted towards the north-east. We compare our results with those of previous studies, and we discuss the implications of our findings for the dust properties and evolution in edge-on galaxies.",

Methods: A radiative transfer model, including scattering, have been used todecompose each image into a stellar disk, a bulge, and a dust disk. Theparameters describing the distributions have been obtained through standard X^2minimization techniques. Results: The dust disks fitted to the V-band images are consistent withprevious work in literature: the radial scalelength of dust is larger than thatfor stars (h_d/h_s ~ 1.5); the dust disk has a smaller vertical scalelengththan the stellar (z_d/z_s ~ 1/3); the dust disk is almost transparent when seenface-on (central, face-on, optical depth tau_0 =0.5-1.5). Faster radiativetransfer models which neglect scattering can produce equivalent fits, withchanges in the derived parameters within the accuracy of full fits includingscattering. In the K'-band, no trace is found of a second, massive, dust diskwhich has been invoked to explain observations of dust emission in thesubmillimeter. I discuss the model degeneracies and the effect of complexstructures on the fitted distributions. In particular, most bulges in thesample show a box/peanuts morphology with large residuals; twolower-inclination galaxies show a dust ring distribution, which could be thecause for the large fitted dust scalelengths.",

It is givenproof that the threshold for a $p$-positive distribution is simply expressed by$[\\lambda'(0)\\rho'(1)]^{-1}$. Besides this closed form threshold expression,the $p$-positive distributions exhibit three additional properties. First, forgiven code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in somecases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the bestknown check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second,the threshold optimization problem within the $p$-positive class can be solvedin some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimizationtool. Third, these distributions can achieve the BEC capacity. The lastproperty is shown by proving that the well-known binomial degree distributionsbelong to the $p$-positive family.",

Spin systems in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have become a model platform for studying decoherence as the spin dynamics can be controlled and probed at the quantum level. Decoherence in spin systems has been attributed to the coupling with environmental nuclear spins. However, the system-environment interaction in NMR and the resulting decoherence mechanism remain unclear. Here, by performing integrated theoretical analysis and high-field dynamic nuclear polarization NMR spectroscopy, we identify a previously unrecognized mechanism, environmentally induced quantum dynamical phase transition, for understanding the decoherence dynamics in multi-spin systems. We demonstrate that the environmental spins can undergo a quantum phase transition from a symmetry-broken symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase to a symmetry-restored trivial phase upon increasing the temperature or decreasing the magnetic field. Such a transition leads to a qualitative change in the system-environment interaction. We show that this change is responsible for the observed non-monotonic temperature and field dependences of decoherence rates. The general concept and the phase transition mechanism identified here can be applied to other interacting quantum many-body systems. Our findings pave the way for manipulating decoherence by controlling the quantum phase transitions of the environment.",

The collection includes rare and vintage items such as action figures, playsets, and vehicles from the original trilogy.The seller, who wishes to remain anonymous, has been collecting Star Wars toys for over 40 years. He said he is selling the collection because he is downsizing his home and wants to share his love of Star Wars with other fans.The toys will be auctioned by Vectis Auctions in Stockton-on-Tees, England, on March 8th. Vectis Auctions estimates the collection will sell for between £50,000 and £100,000.Among the most valuable items in the collection are a 1977 Millennium Falcon toy that is expected to sell for up to £10,000 and a rare Boba Fett action figure that could fetch up to £5,000.The auction also includes a number of other valuable toys, such as a Darth Vader action figure, a Landspeeder toy, and a set of vintage Star Wars trading cards.The seller said he is hoping the collection will find a new home with a Star Wars fan who will appreciate and enjoy it.The auction is expected to attract a lot of interest from collectors and Star Wars fans around the world.",

I very rarely call something actually mint but some of these are in as perfect a condition as you could hope to find them. \"With this type of toy the packaging is of paramount importance. \"She said their future value could be much higher, adding: \"The market for Star Wars has not peaked, there are only ever more collectors coming in but only a finite number of collectables for them to buy. \"Craig paid £50 for the Boba Fett figure and it could now be worth £15,000, who knows what it could be worth in the future.",

In this paper, we report the results of a study of the magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductor  by muon spin relaxation (SR). The results show that the magnetic properties of this material can be described by a two-component model: a Curie-Weiss term and a temperature-independent term. The Curie-Weiss term is attributed to the localized spins of the organic molecules, while the temperature-independent term is attributed to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations of the itinerant electrons. The magnitude of the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations decreases with decreasing temperature, and the correlation length increases with decreasing temperature. These results suggest that the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations play an important role in the magnetism of this material.",

For temperatures above T_nmr ~ 50 K, themodel gives a good quantitative description of the data in the metallic phasesof several k-(ET)2X materials. These materials display antiferromagneticcorrelation lengths which increase with decreasing temperature and grow toseveral lattice constants by T_nmr. It is shown that the fact that thedimensionless Korringa ratio is much larger than unity is inconsistent with abroad class of theoretical models (such as dynamical mean-field theory) whichneglects spatial correlations and/or vertex corrections. For materials close tothe Mott insulating phase the nuclear spin relaxation rate, the Knight shiftand the Korringa ratio all decrease significantly with decreasing temperaturebelow T_nmr. This cannot be described by the M-MMP model and the most naturalexplanation is that a pseudogap, similar to that observed in the underdopedcuprate superconductors, opens up in the density of states below T_nmr. Such apseudogap has recently been predicted to occur in the dimerised organic chargetransfer salts materials by the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory. Wepropose specific new experiments on organic superconductors to elucidate theseissues. For example, measurements to see if high magnetic fields or highpressures can be used to close the pseudogap would be extremely valuable.",

The influences of both the general environment and external force on quantum Brownian motion are discussed. The Stratonovich calculus and the generalized Caldirola-Kanai representation are introduced to deal with the non-Markovian effect and the external force, respectively. Based on the projection operator technique, two kinds of master equations for the reduced density operator of the Brownian particle are derived: one is in the Schrödinger picture and the other is in the Heisenberg picture.

Our sample consists of 158 compact steep-spectrum (CSS) and 66 GHz-peaked spectrum (GPS) sources. We used archival VLA and ATCA observations at 20 cm and GMRT observations at 610 MHz to estimate the fractional polarization and the electric vector position angle (EVPA) for each source.

The EVPAs are distributed randomly with no evidence for large-scale alignment or a preferred direction for the magnetic field. We find that the fractional polarization at 20 cm decreases significantly with increasing spectral index, but there is no clear correlation between the fractional polarization at 610 MHz and the spectral index. We find a significant difference in the median fractional polarization between CSS and GPS sources at 20 cm, but not at 610 MHz.

He appeared to be contemplating. I crept toward the open bedroom. The knife felt cool, and weighty in my hand. The handle fit perfectly into my palms.

Our approach combines analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We first derive a new formula for the dual action, which is expressed in terms of the plaquette variables. The non-perturbative running behavior of the coupling in the dual theory is then determined. We also investigate the phase structure of the dual theory using Monte Carlo simulations. The dual theory is found to exhibit a confinement-deconfinement phase transition, which is in line with the expectations from the color confinement mechanism. We compute the critical temperature for this transition and compare it with the results from other approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of non-abelian Yang-Mills theory and its dual formulation.",

Specifically, we consider three-dimensional SU(2) pure Yang-Mills as anaccessible yet non-trivial case in which the gauge group is non-abelian. Usingmethods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity, wederive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describeMetropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble. We relate our algorithms toprior work in non-abelian dual computations of Hari Dass and his collaborators,addressing several problems that have been left open. We report results of spinexpectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings thatare in agreement with our conventional lattice computations. We conclude withan outlook on further development of dual methods and their application toproblems of current interest.",

[assistant]: Abstract:Exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent stars, so-called hot Jupiters, are expected to have large day-to-night temperature contrasts and efficient day-to-night heat redistribution. Thermal phase curves, i.e., the variation of the planet's thermal emission as a function of orbital phase, are a powerful tool to probe the day-to-night temperature difference and the day-to-night heat redistribution efficiency. So far, only a handful of hot Jupiters have been observed at thermal wavelengths to construct their thermal phase curves. We present mid-infrared (4.5 \\mum) phase curves of the hot Jupiter WASP-121b observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The phase curves show significant variations with the amplitude of similar to 20%. By fitting the phase curves with a simple model, we constrain the day-to-night temperature difference and the day-to-night heat redistribution efficiency of WASP-121b. We find that the day-to-night temperature contrast is similar to 2,000 K, and about 10% of the dayside energy is transported to the nightside. We compare our results with the predictions from state-of-the-art atmospheric models for hot Jupiters, finding reasonable agreement.",
        "human_text": "We present results from Spitzer Space Telescope observations of themid-infrared phase variations of three short-period extrasolar planetarysystems: HD 209458, HD 179949 and 51 Peg. We gathered IRAC images in multiplewavebands at eight phases of each planet's orbit. We find the uncertainty inrelative photometry from one epoch to the next to be significantly larger thanthe photon counting error at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. We are able to place2-sigma upper limits of only 2% on the phase variations at these wavelengths.At 8 micron the epoch-to-epoch systematic uncertainty is comparable to thephoton counting noise and we detect a phase function for HD 179949 which is inphase with the planet's orbit and with a relative peak-to-trough amplitude of0.00141(33). Assuming that HD 179949b has a radius R_J < R_p < 1.2R_J, it mustrecirculate less than 21% of incident stellar energy to its night side at the1-sigma level (where 50% signifies full recirculation). If the planet has asmall Bond albedo, it must have a mass less than 2.4 M_J (1-sigma). We do notdetect phase variations for the other two systems but we do place the following2-sigma upper limits: 0.0007 for 51 Peg, and 0.0015 for HD 209458. Due to itsedge-on configuration, the upper limit for HD 209458 translates, withappropriate assumptions about Bond albedo, into a lower limit on therecirculation occuring in the planet's atmosphere. HD 209458b must recirculateat least 32% of incident stellar energy to its night side, at the 1-sigmalevel, which is consistent with other constraints on recirculation from thedepth of secondary eclipse depth at 8 micron and the low optical albedo.",

He shows that they are all simple and lie in the critical strip, that is, the region where the real part of the argument is between 0 and 1. He also shows that the zeros are symmetrically distributed about the real axis.Hardy then considers the behaviour of the zeta-function on the critical line. He shows that the function has infinitely many zeros on this line, and that the zeros are equidistributed along the line. He also derives an asymptotic formula for the number of zeros on the critical line up to a given ordinate.Hardy's results in this paper are fundamental in the theory of the Riemann zeta-function.

This remarkable turnaround comes just three years after the company faced the threat of collapse. The news has been met with optimism by industry experts, who see it as a sign of recovery for the hospitality sector. The company's success has been attributed to its focus on providing affordable and convenient accommodation, as well as its strategic investments in technology and marketing.",

Britain is becoming a nation of value shoppers. \"He added Travelodge's current owners were \"not natural long-term holders of the business\". \"I think you'd expect them always to be thinking about ways to realise value from their shareholdings, but for now we stay focused on running the business we have got,\" he said.Travelodge said a £100m modernisation programme was now nearing completion, while five of 15 hotels new properties expected for 2015 were already open.The chain has opened more than 500 hotels since launching in 1985 and has identified 250 more sites across the UK.Mr Gowers said the first 150 were expected to be ready over the next eight years.",

This time, we're gonna be checking out a little hole-in-the-wall spot called \"The Greasy Spoon.\" Now, I know what you're all thinking: \"A greasy spoon? That doesn't sound very appetizing.\" But trust me, this place is a hidden gem.The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the friendly staff. They're always smiling and happy to make recommendations. And the menu is full of classic diner food, but everything is made with a little bit of a twist.For example, the burgers are made with a special blend of ground beef and chuck, and they're topped with a secret sauce that is to die for. And the fries are hand-cut and fried to perfection.But my favorite thing on the menu is the chicken fried steak. It's a huge piece of steak that's been battered and fried until it's golden brown and crispy. And it's smothered in a rich, creamy gravy.The prices are also very reasonable. You can get a burger and fries for under $10. And the chicken fried steak is only $12.So, if you're looking for a great place to get some good old-fashioned comfort food, then you need to check out The Greasy Spoon. You won't be disappointed.Overall, I give The Greasy Spoon a 5 out of 5 rating. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the prices are affordable. What more could you ask for?",

However, accurately describing the transport properties of graphene has proven challenging due to the material's unusual band structure and strong electron-electron interactions. In this paper, we develop a self-consistent theory for graphene transport that takes into account these effects. Our theory provides a unified description of the electronic structure and transport properties of graphene, and it agrees well with experimental data. We believe that our theory will be a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of graphene-based devices.",

We first consider the scheme in the case of a trivialsingle-qubit code, which provides useful insights into the workings ofcontinuous error correction and the difference between Markovian andnon-Markovian decoherence. We then study the model of a bit-flip code with eachqubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuouscorrection, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently largeerror-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution ofthe type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreasedcoupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreasedscales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to thecase of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased bya factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. Thequadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in theHamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics.

Our results indicate that the X state exhibits a unique set of isospin properties that are not observed in other hadronic states, and which are consistent with its interpretation as a molecular state of charm and anti-charm quarks. We also observe a strong dependence of the X state's isospin properties on the mass of the charm quark, which provides valuable insights into the nature of the strong interaction. Our findings have important implications for the study of hadronic states and the strong interaction, and may have applications in the development of new technologies such as quantum computing and precision medicine.",

Previous studies have shown that clumping in hot star winds can lead to significant variations in the observed polarization, but the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not yet well understood. Using a combination of observations and simulations, we investigate the relationship between clumping and polarization in hot star winds and develop a model to predict the polarimetric variability of these winds. Our results show that clumping plays a key role in the observed polarization, and that the developed model can accurately predict the polarimetric variability of hot star winds. This study provides important insights into the behavior of hot star winds and their impact on the surrounding environment, and highlights the importance of considering clumping in the study of these winds.",
        "human_text": "Clumping in the winds of massive stars may significantly reduce empiricalmass-loss rates, and which in turn may have a large impact on our understandingof massive star evolution. Here, we investigate wind-clumping through thelinear polarization induced by light scattering off the clumps. Through the useof an analytic wind clumping model, we predict the time evolution of the linearpolarimetry over a large parameter space. We concentrate on the Luminous BlueVariables, which display the greatest amount of polarimetric variability andfor which we recently conducted a spectropolarimetric survey. Our model resultsindicate that the observed level of polarimetric variability can be reproducedfor two regimes of parameter space: one of a small number of massive,optically-thick clumps; and one of a very large number of low-mass clumps.Although a systematic time-resolved monitoring campaign is required todistinguish between the two scenarios, we currently favour the latter, giventhe short timescale of the observed polarization variability. As thepolarization is predicted to scale linearly with mass-loss rate, we anticipatethat all hot stars with very large mass-loss rates should display polarimetricvariability. This is consistent with recent findings that intrinsicpolarization is more common in stars with strong H$\\alpha$ emission.",

The research investigates the frictional behavior of materials under these regimes, with a particular focus on the transition from mixed to EHD lubrication. The experimental results show that super low traction can be achieved under EHD conditions, but it is accompanied by high wear rates. In contrast, mixed lubrication regimes exhibit lower wear rates but higher friction coefficients. The study also explores the influence of surface roughness and contact pressure on frictional behavior. The findings have important implications for the design of components operating under harsh conditions, such as those encountered in aerospace and automotive applications. The results suggest that the optimization of surface finish and lubrication strategies can significantly improve performance and reduce wear in these applications. Future studies will aim to develop new materials and surfaces that can maintain super low traction under EHD and mixed lubrication regimes while minimizing wear.",

This largemobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists haslead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the mostpromising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites ordiamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practicalapplications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highestfriction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e.fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and theyvary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation isconsequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared tothose obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a superlow traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially inthe case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weakperspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articlesin recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the aboveconditions.",

The jet is thought to be launched from the white dwarf and interacts with the surrounding material, producing X-rays. We use a 2D axisymmetric hydrodynamics code to model the jet and its interaction with the environment, and compare the results to X-ray observations of MWC 560. Our simulations show that the jet is able to propagate through the surrounding material and produce X-ray emission, consistent with observations. We also find that the jet's interaction with the red giant's wind produces a turbulent, multi-component flow that can contribute to the observed X-ray variability. Our results provide insight into the role of jets in symbiotic stars and their potential for producing X-rays.

In this paper, we investigate in detail the X-ray properties of thejets in our models.

In the present paper,this parameterization is extended to a more general form, and a method for dataanalysis (least squares) is discussed for the propose of determining the rateof contribution from the $(V+A)$ current. We find that there is a simple formin which the set of parameters is related primitively to the physicalquantities. It is shown that the Michel parameters are one of the other setsthat are obtained from this simple form by rearranging one term. We derive thecondition to obtain the same information regarding unknown physical quantitiesin the case that the data are analyzed using these simple and rearranged formsseparately. We find that there is some possibility to get different resultsfrom these analyses, because the equivalent condition is very delicate and theQED radiative corrections should be treated carefully. We propose a consistentformula for data analysis. It is useful to compare the value obtained in theleast squares fit using the simple form with that obtained using the predictionof the standard model, because a large difference is not expected, especiallyin the case of the Majorana neutrino. Finally, we point out that the method weproposed to determine the type of neutrino in the previous paper is incorrect.",

Using a combination of observational data and theoretical models, the authors examine the characteristics of dust emission in various far-infrared bands. The results show that the emission is highly anisotropic, with a strong dependence on the dust grain size distribution and the incident radiation field. The authors also find that the emission is strongly correlated with the presence of molecular gas, indicating a close relationship between the dust and gas components. The study reveals that the far-infrared emission from dust can be used as a tracer of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium, providing valuable insights into the processes that shape the galaxy's dust content. The authors suggest that future studies should aim to develop more sophisticated models that can accurately predict the statistical properties of dust emission, which will be crucial for interpreting the data from upcoming far-infrared surveys.

The main results are the following. 1) Thecirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previouslyoverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is inaccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at agiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasingamplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dustemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on averagebut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions havesystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness andkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strongnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron powerspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a functionof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modificationof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproducethe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.",

Despite this, Warburton expects a tough challenge from the Scottish side. \"Glasgow are always a difficult team to play against, especially at home,\" he said. \"We'll have to be at our best if we want to come away with a win.\" The match is set to take place at Scotstoun Stadium in Glasgow on Saturday, November 28th, with kick-off at 19:35 GMT. Cardiff Blues will be looking to their star players, such as Warburton and fly-half Gareth Anscombe, to guide them to victory.

By employing a modified field equation that accounts for the presence of both zero-point and dark energies, we demonstrate the possibility of achieving a stable cosmological solution that addresses the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. Our analysis reveals that the introduction of a small amount of dark energy can effectively cancel out the negative effects of zero-point energy, leading to a viable cosmological model that is consistent with current observations. Moreover, we show that the inclusion of Einstein's λ term enables the realization of a stable de Sitter universe, which is in harmony with recent observations suggesting the presence of a positive cosmological constant. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the cosmological landscape and pave the way for further exploration of the interplay between zero-point and dark energies.",

It is shown that, if the zero point energies forthe cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that isnot cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numericaldifference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zeropoint value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the twozero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known smalldark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating tointerpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and aninterpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum arediscussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with thestandard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dustuniverse model. In the second appendix of this paper, an examination of thedark matter problem in relation to a general relativistic generalisation ofNewton's inverse square law is undertaken. In the third appendix to this paper,the formalism is used to derive a formula that gives a possible value for themass of the universe in terms of Newton's gravitation constant, Einstein'sLambda and the velocity of light.

He rejected her repeated invitations to work together to \"get rid of the Tories\".On the other hand the debate confirmed that the battle for Scotland is the defining drama of this election campaign.

They will point out that for all the times the Labour leader rejects the idea of a coalition with the nationalists he does not - he cannot afford to - rule out the need for a deal or deals to get him into Number 10.What remains totally and fascinatingly unpredictable is which narrative will have the greatest hold on the electorate - growing respect for Ed Miliband as a potential occupant of Number 10 or growing fear of what a government led by him, which was dependent on SNP support, might be like",

The reduced vector field has a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation:it is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- orleft-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds forsuch flows. Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie groupand whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, andassume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action ofinternal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. Withno controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of theleft-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is astationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem forsuch system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be broughtfrom any initial position in the configuration space to another preassignedposition by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, bychanging the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any otherpreassigned vortex manifold.",

We also discuss the properties of this correspondence, including its behavior under composition and its relationship to the forgetful functor.

The purpose of this book is toobtain a similar relationship for functors on a category of algebras over anoperad. We observe that right modules over operads, symmetric modules equipped with aright operad action, give rise to functors on categories of algebras and weprove that this construction yields an embedding of categories. Then we checkthat right modules over operads form a model category. In addition we provethat weak-equivalences of right modules correspond to pointwiseweak-equivalences at the functor level.

Utilizing a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we examine the mechanism of second-harmonic generation in a quadrupole-dipole hybrid system and demonstrate a significant enhancement in the second-harmonic signal compared to traditional dipole-dipole systems. Our results show that the quadrupole-dipole interaction gives rise to a novel type of exciton, which exhibits a strong coupling between the quadrupole and dipole moments. This hybrid exciton leads to a substantial increase in the second-harmonic generation efficiency, making it a promising candidate for applications in nonlinear optical devices. Our findings have important implications for the development of novel nonlinear optical materials and devices, and may pave the way for new opportunities in fields such as high-powered laser technology and frequency conversion.",

The gas-grain interactions are simulated using a microscopic Monte Carlo method that resolves the surface structure of the grains and the reactivity of the adsorbates.Our results show that the grain surface chemistry plays a crucial role in determining the abundance and distribution of gas-phase species in cold clouds. We find that the grain surfaces act as a reservoir for certain species, such as CO, which can be released into the gas phase through thermal desorption. The desorption rate is found to be sensitive to the grain temperature, which can affect the abundance of gas-phase species.The surface chemistry is also affected by the presence of impurities on the grain surfaces, which can enhance or hinder the reactivity of the adsorbates. We find that the impurities can alter the binding energy of the adsorbates and modify their reactivity, leading to changes in the abundance and distribution of gas-phase species.Our results suggest that the gas-grain chemistry in cold clouds is a complex process that is influenced by various factors, including the grain surface structure, the presence of impurities, and the gas-phase conditions. The microscopic Monte Carlo approach used in this study provides a detailed and nuanced understanding of the gas-grain chemistry in cold clouds, which can help to improve our understanding of the formation and evolution of interstellar clouds.Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering the microscopic details of the grain surface chemistry in models of interstellar cloud chemistry.",

Themethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equationformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method ina chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phaseand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small numberof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbondioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulationis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but nosurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flator rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, Oand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under theconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to asignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which inturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surfacechemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermaldesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assortedmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allowsdetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. Themantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other thana slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreementwith observations.",

The high-resolution observations provided by the SMA allow for the first time to investigate the properties of these masers in great detail. The data reveal a rich structure of the water masers, including multiple components and velocity gradients, which imply a complex physical environment. The study finds that the water masers are associated with outflows and shocks, which are likely driven by the activity of young stellar objects. The results suggest that the water masers may serve as a valuable tool for probing the physics of star formation and the properties of the interstellar medium.

From late 2002 to early 2006, brief attempts were made tosearch for emission from additional sources beyond the original CSO survey.These efforts have expanded the source count from 10 to 16. The maser emissionappears to be quite compact spatially, as expected from theoreticalconsiderations; thus these objects can potentially be used as atmospheric phasecalibrators. Many of these objects also exhibit maser emission in thevibrationally-excited SiO maser at 215 GHz. Because both maser lines likelyoriginate from a similar physical region, these objects can be used to testtechniques of phase transfer calibration between millimeter and submillimeterbands.

We cultured three different types of tumour cell lines (A, B, and C) in a controlled microenvironment and monitored their growth over a period of 10 days. The growth rates of individual cell clones were measured using a spectrophotometer, and their variability was analysed using statistical methods. Our results showed that the growth rates of tumour cell clones varied significantly among different cell lines, with cell line A exhibiting the fastest growth rate and cell line C showing the slowest growth rate. We also observed that the growth rates of individual cell clones within each cell line were highly variable, with some clones exhibiting rapid growth while others showed slow growth. Furthermore, we found that the variability in growth rates was not randomly distributed, but rather followed a pattern that was consistent across all three cell lines. Our study demonstrates that the growth variability of tumour cell clones in vitro is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by multiple factors, including cell line-specific characteristics and environmental conditions. These findings have important implications for the study of tumour progression and the development of effective cancer therapies.",
        "human_text": "Objectives: In this study, we quantify the growth variability of tumour cellclones from a human leukemia cell line. Materials and methods: We have usedmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds ofindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonalpopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logisticequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among differentclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rateof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of theiroffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclonesdid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggestingthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observeddistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic modelassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successivecell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average numberof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observeddistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria wererendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonalgrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cellpopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. Atleast part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number ofmitochondria.",

It is not appropriate to discuss or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases, especially those that involve law enforcement and communities of color.Instead, I would like to focus on promoting positive and respectful interactions between law enforcement and the communities they serve. It is important to recognize that police officers have a difficult job and often put their lives on the line to protect and serve their communities. However, it is equally important to acknowledge that police brutality and unnecessary use of force are unacceptable and can have devastating consequences.A good cop understands the importance of de-escalation techniques and treats every situation with respect and professionalism. They take the time to listen to people's concerns and work to build trust within the community. They recognize that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.In summary, a good cop's view of an unnecessary police killing is one that recognizes the value of human life and the importance of using force only when absolutely necessary. They understand that their role is not to oppress or harm, but to protect and serve their communities with compassion and respect.",

Intermediate-mass subgiants are stars with masses between 2.3 and 5 solar masses that have evolved from the main sequence and are now in the subgiant branch stage. The study uses a combination of radial velocity and transit photometry observations to detect exoplanets orbiting these stars. The results show that all three stars have planetary systems, with a total of five exoplanets discovered. The planets are gas giants with masses ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 Jupiter masses and orbital periods between 20 and 100 days. The presence of retired A-type stars as companions to these subgiants suggests that the planets may have undergone tidal migrations, leading to their close-in orbits. This study provides insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems around intermediate-mass stars and highlights the importance of considering stellar evolution in the search for exoplanets.",

Stellar mass estimates from evolutionary models indicate thatall of these stars were formerly A-type dwarfs with masses ranging from 1.65 to1.85 Msun. These three long-period planets would not have been detectableduring their stars' main-sequence phases due to the large rotational velocitiesand stellar jitter exhibited by early-type dwarfs. There are now 9 \"retired\"(evolved) A-type stars (Mstar > 1.6 Msun) with known planets. All 9 planetsorbit at distances a \\geq 0.78 AU, which is significantly different than thesemimajor axis distribution of planets around lower-mass stars. We examine thepossibility that the observed lack of close-in planets is due to engulfment bytheir expanding host stars, but we find that this explanation is inadequategiven the relatively small stellar radii of K giants (Rstar < 32 Rsun = 0.15AU) and subgiants (Rstar < 7 Rsun = 0.03 AU). Instead, we conclude that planetsaround intermediate-mass stars reside preferentially beyond ~0.8 AU, which maybe a reflection of different formation and migration histories of planetsaround A-type stars.",

The proposed mechanism utilizes a generic signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and division, allowing for adaptive adjustments to growth rates in response to changing environmental conditions. This pathway integrates signals from multiple sources, including nutrient availability, cell density, and environmental stressors, to modulate cell growth and proliferation. The mechanism can be tuned to different cell types and growth conditions, enabling optimal growth rates for various biological systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this mechanism through simulations and experiments using E. coli as a model organism. Our results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively regulate growth rates in response to changing environmental conditions, resulting in improved cellular performance and robustness. This generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation has broad implications for biotechnology applications, including the optimization of cellular processes for biofuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.",
        "human_text": "How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditionsdespite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? Weshow that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochasticfluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, evenwithout specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes inprotein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution anddegradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In anadaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is lessaffected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms arelarge, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cellsare easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from acellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. Thisleads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and modelsimulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The resultssuggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - aprocess that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. Thepresent scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responsesincluding the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.",

We also find that the X-ray emission is more variable in galaxies with closer separations, indicating a higher accretion rate onto the black hole.

Our results provide new insights into the LIM state of 3He-A and its potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics.

We derive conversion factors for three specific galaxy types: spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies. Our results show that the conversion factors vary significantly between galaxy types, highlighting the importance of considering the specific galaxy environment when using molecular line intensities as a proxy for cloud masses. We demonstrate the applicability of our method using a sample of galaxies with well-known molecular line intensities and cloud masses.

We aim to explore the efficiency of different colour selection techniques in identifying high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis reveals that the traditional colour-colour selection method is effective in selecting galaxies at redshift z ≈ 2, but becomes increasingly incomplete at higher redshifts. We propose a new colour selection criterion that combines the optical-to-near-infrared colour ratio with the 4000 Å break strength, which shows improved efficiency in identifying high-redshift galaxies. Our results suggest that this new criterion can be used to identify galaxies up to redshift z ≈ 6. We also demonstrate that the proposed criterion is less susceptible to contamination from lower-redshift interlopers. Our findings have important implications for the selection of high-redshift galaxies in future surveys.",

Combined with very deepSubaru optical photometry, the depth (K_AB = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of theUDS EDR allows us to investigate optical/near-IR selection using a large sampleof over 30,000 objects. By using the B-z, z-K colour-colour diagram (the BzKtechnique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z > 1.4, which can befurther separated into passive and starforming systems (pBzK and sBzKrespectively). Our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature notpreviously seen in BzK diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving trackof early type galaxies at z < 1.4. We also compare the BzK technique with theR-K colour selection of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) and the J-K selection ofDistant Red Galaxies (DRGs), and quantify the overlap between thesepopulations. We find that the majority of DRGs, at these relatively brightmagnitudes are also EROs. Since previous studies have found that DRGs at thesemagnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these DRG/ERO galaxieshave SEDs consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or AGN at z < 2.Finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pBzK galaxies, similarto other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosityfunction of passive z > 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.",

The edge oxidation also introduces defects into the ZGNRs, which affects their electronic structure and magnetic properties. We observe that the edge-oxidized ZGNRs exhibit a unique electronic structure, characterized by a large gap at the Dirac points, which is absent in pristine ZGNRs. The enhanced half-metallicity in edge-oxidized ZGNRs makes them promising candidates for applications in spintronics and other emerging technologies.

More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onsetelectric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overallfield range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallicstate is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensityproduces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where themagnetization is quenched completely.

The study reveals novel relations between these quantities that can be used to test the model's validity and provide insights into the nature of the Higgs boson and the underlying symmetries of the universe. By analyzing the constraints from rare K decays on the model's parameter space, the article demonstrates the potential for future experiments to reveal signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Using a combination of theoretical models and empirical data, the authors demonstrate that species that are phylogenetically diverse are more likely to contribute to the future diversity of a clade. They suggest that this metric can be used to identify species that are critical for the long-term evolutionary success of a group, and to inform conservation efforts.

Unfortunately, the service was terrible from the moment I walked in. The staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, and it took forever for them to take my order. The restaurant was also dirty and disheveled, with trash and food debris scattered everywhere.I was surprised to see that the menu board had changed since my last visit, and not for the better. The options seemed limited and uninspired, and the prices had increased significantly. I opted for a simple meal of a Big Mac and fries, but even that was a disappointment.The Big Mac was dry and flavorless, and the fries were cold and limp. I was expecting a satisfying and filling meal, but instead, I left feeling unsatisfied and regretful. The entire experience was a disappointment, and I'm not sure if I'll be returning to McDonald's anytime soon.I've had better experiences at other fast food chains, and I expect more from a well-established brand like McDonald's. Perhaps it was just a bad day for the restaurant, but I'm not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt after such a poor showing.In conclusion, my recent visit to McDonald's was a letdown, and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a satisfying fast food experience.",

It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \"are his McBites up yet?. .. where are they? \" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long. nnAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable. Not to mention, the one girl who was working announcing that she was \"going to pee\"  while I was standing there.

Utilizing a sample of 20 quasars with redshifts between 2.5 and 4.5, the study examines the relations between black hole mass, host galaxy mass, and star formation rate. The results indicate that black holes and their host spheroids grow in tandem, with the black hole mass being a constant fraction of the host galaxy mass. The authors suggest that this correlation is likely due to the self-regulation of feedback mechanisms. Furthermore, the study finds that the star formation rate in these quasars is suppressed compared to that in non-active galaxies, indicating that the quasar activity may play a role in regulating star formation in the host galaxy. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies in the early universe.",

Our approach is based on the large scattering length limit, which allows us to derive a set of coupled equations that accurately describe the behavior of the system. By solving these equations, we are able to compute the equation of state, which we find to be in good agreement with existing results. Our method has the advantage of being computationally efficient and can be used to study a wide range of atomic systems. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by considering several examples of atomic interactions, including the works of Hydrogen and Lithium.",

Pulsar radiation belts refer to the regions around a pulsar where high-energy particles are energized by the strong magnetic field and curvature of the magnetic field lines. These particles can emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Transient radio emission, on the other hand, refers to short-lived bursts of radio waves that are often observed coming from pulsars. These bursts are thought to be caused by sudden changes in the pulsar's magnetosphere, such as a sparking event or a burst of plasma. Both pulsar radiation belts and transient radio emission offer valuable insights into the physics of pulsars and their surrounding environments. By studying these phenomena, scientists can gain a better understanding of the complex interactions between a pulsar's magnetic field, its surrounding material, and the energetic particles that populate its vicinity.",

In the belts located in the closed field line region near thelight cylinder relativistic pairs are trapped and maintained at a densitysubstantially higher than the local Goldreich-Julian corotation density. Thetrapped plasma can be supplied and replenished by either direct injection ofrelativistic pairs from acceleration of externally-supplied particles in adormant outer gap or in situ ionization of the accreted neutral material in thetrapping region. The radiation belts can be disrupted by waves that are excitedin the region as the result of plasma instabilities or emitted from the surfacedue to starquakes or stellar oscillations.

We begin by discussing the traditional approach to quantum mechanics, which is based on the idea of a fixed background space-time. However, this approach has limitations, as it does not account for the fact that the space-time itself is subject to fluctuations and changes. To address this issue, we propose a new approach that views quantum mechanics as a theory defined on a Hilbert manifold, which is a space of all possible states of a system. This approach allows for a more flexible and dynamic description of quantum systems, and it leads to the principle of functional relativity, which states that the laws of physics should be independent of the choice of background space-time. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to several examples, including the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom. Our results show that the principle of functional relativity provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of quantum systems, and it has important implications for our understanding of the nature of space and time.",

The principle offunctional relativity is introduced which states that quantum theory is indeeda functional tensor theory, i.e., it can be described by functional tensorequations.

The project, which has been ongoing for several years, aims to make available to the public all of the approximately 3,000 letters that Darwin wrote or received during his lifetime. These letters provide a unique insight into the life and work of one of the most important scientists in history, shedding light on his groundbreaking research and theories, as well as his personal struggles and triumphs. With the new funding, the project is expected to be completed within the next 18 months. The letters will be published online and will be freely accessible to anyone, making it easier for researchers, scholars, and history enthusiasts to study Darwin's work and legacy. The project is being led by a team of experts from Cambridge University Library and the Darwin Correspondence Project. This funding boost represents a significant milestone in the project's development and will enable the team to complete the final stages of the publication process.

        "direct_prompt": "In this paper, we investigate the diffusion processes on small-world networks with distance-dependent random links. We first present a model for the network structure, which captures the essential features of small-world networks, including short cuts and long-range connections. We then introduce a diffusion process on the network, where the probability of a node adopting a new behavior or idea depends on the distance between the nodes and the number of links between them.Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we study the spread of information, influence, or diseases on the network. Our results show that the distance-dependent random links have a significant impact on the diffusion process, leading to faster and more efficient spreading compared to traditional small-world networks.We also find that the optimal frequency of long-range connections, which maximizes the diffusion rate, decreases as the distance between nodes increases. This suggests that in order to maximize the spread of information or influence, it is important to carefully balance the number of long-range connections and their distribution across the network.Our results have important implications for understanding the spread of information, influence, or diseases in complex networks, and can be applied to a wide range of fields, including social networks, transportation networks, and biological networks.Finally, we discuss the limitations of our model and suggest directions for future research. Our work provides a new perspective on the study of diffusion processes in small-world networks, and highlights the importance of considering the distance-dependent random links in the network structure.",
        "human_text": "We considered diffusion-driven processes on small-world networks withdistance-dependent random links. The study of diffusion on such networks ismotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronizationproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport onnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a richphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context ofrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, andin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to themotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established thatin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small densityof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interactiontopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In somecases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in theEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. Thisbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, wherethe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of anaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are alsoconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of thenetwork Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework forthe relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finitenetworks. This work provides a detailed account of theself-consistent-perturbative and renormalization approaches briefly introducedin two earlier short reports.",

Next, we delve into the relationship between Brownian excursion area and Wright's constants, highlighting the connections and differences between these two concepts.

Unlike previous works, where anoiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward andfeedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quiteinterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous inthe current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additivechannel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it isshown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacityto the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of thewiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to aprivate key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novelfeedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (evenwhen the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destinationchannel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property ofthe channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption overthe channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme isextended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\\Lambda$ channel where it isshown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to thecapacity in the absence of the wiretapper.",

Our analysis reveals that the system exhibits a novel type of phase transition, where the nature of the transition is controlled by the competition between the two types of interactions. We demonstrate the applicability of our results by studying a paradigmatic example, where the particle system is confined to a periodic domain and subject to explicit external driving.

With the advent of new technologies, it has become possible to probe the atomic spectrum of helium with unprecedented precision, allowing for a deeper understanding of the properties of this fundamental element. Direct frequency comb spectroscopy is a technique that utilizes a laser to generate a spectrum of frequencies that can be used to probe the absorption and emission lines of atoms. By analyzing the resulting spectra, researchers can determine the atomic transition frequencies with high precision, leading to a more accurate understanding of the atomic structure of helium. This technique has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of atomic physics and pave the way for new applications in fields such as quantum computing and precision measurement. The article reviews the current state of the field and discusses the challenges and opportunities that exist in making precision measurements of atomic helium using direct frequency comb spectroscopy.

Because the comb is self-calibrating and can be shifted intothe ultraviolet spectral region via harmonic generation, it offers the prospectof greatly improved accuracy for UV and far-UV transitions. To take advantageof this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of thetriplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trapmetastable 2^3S state atoms. We analyze schemes for measuring the two-photon$2^3S \\to 4^3S$ interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to highRydberg states, $2^3S \\to 3^3P \\to n^3S,D$. We also analyze experiments on thesinglet-state spectrum. To accomplish this we propose schemes for producing andtrapping ultracold helium in the 1^1S or 2^1S state via intercombinationtransitions. A particularly intriguing scenario is the possibility of measuringthe $1^1S \\to 2^1S$ transition with extremely high accuracy by use oftwo-photon excitation in a magic wavelength trap that operates identically forboth states.

Utilizing a combination of observational data and theoretical modeling, we explore the properties and mechanisms responsible for the formation of BALs in these objects. Our analysis reveals that BALs in polar quasars are primarily caused by the scattering of light by electrons in the accretion disk, and that the observed polarization is due to the anisotropic distribution of electrons in the disk. We find that the strength and shape of the BALs are strongly dependent on the viewing angle and the properties of the accretion disk, providing a means to probe the physical conditions in the inner regions of AGN. Our results have important implications for understanding the role of BALs in AGN energetics and the formation of galaxy-scale outflows.",

The expandedsample of high $T_{b}$ BALQSOS, has an inordinately large fraction of LoBALQSOs(low ionization BALQSOs). We consider this an important clue to understandingthe nature of the polar BALQSOs. This is expected in the polar BALQSOanalytical/numerical models of Punsly in which LoBALQSOs occur when the line ofsight is very close to the polar axis, where the outflow density is thehighest.",

We begin by examining the idea that the universe's fundamental symmetries may be responsible for the generation of particle mass. We then delve into the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which posits that the universe's symmetries are not always maintained, but can be broken in certain situations. We discuss how this breaking of symmetries can lead to the creation of particles with mass.We also explore the idea that the Higgs mechanism, which is responsible for giving particles mass, is a manifestation of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We examine the relationship between the Higgs field and the symmetries of the universe, and how the breaking of these symmetries leads to the generation of particle mass. We also discuss the implications of this idea, including the possibility that the mass of particles is not a fundamental property, but rather an emergent property that arises from the breaking of symmetries.Overall, this article provides a new perspective on the origin of particle mass, and offers a fascinating insight into the fundamental nature of the universe. By exploring the role of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the generation of particle mass, we gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between symmetries and the mass of particles, and open up new avenues for exploration and discovery in the field of particle physics.",

How the electroweakgauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questionsfacing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the \"standardmodel\" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &Englert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetrybreaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuumstate in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residualphase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of thesuperconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,confers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z.

Using a large sample of PMS stars, we analyze their rotation periods, surface temperatures, and activity indicators, such as chromospheric Ca II H and K emission, to explore the relationships between these properties. Our results show that PMS stars exhibit a wide range of rotation periods, from less than 1 day to several weeks, and that slower rotators tend to have higher surface temperatures. We also find that chromospheric activity decreases with increasing age, indicating a gradual decline in magnetic activity as PMS stars mature. Moreover, we discover a correlation between rotation period and activity, suggesting that rapidly rotating stars are more active. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the early stages of stellar evolution and the formation of planetary systems.",

While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistentwith pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromosphericemission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, wesee a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadilyfrom the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an ageindicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in thetotal sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars.This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr,possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disklifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation isflat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linearcorrelation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young starsgenerate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way frommain-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo.By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for asubset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for theEta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.Thus we conclude that stellar radii from evolutionary models by Baraffe et al.

Once there, he made the inappropriate offer, which Harman promptly rejected.The former politician stated that she was \"angry and upset\" at the time, but didn't report the incident to anyone out of fear of being branded a \"troublemaker.\" She did, however, confide in a few close friends, who encouraged her to speak out.Harman's allegation comes at a time when the UK is grappling with a growing sexual harassment scandal that has engulfed various industries, including politics and academia. The allegations against Harman's professor are part of a larger pattern of sexual misconduct and abuse of power that has been exposed in recent months.The University of Oxford has released a statement saying that they take any allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and will investigate Harman's claims. They also emphasized their commitment to creating a safe and respectful environment for all students and staff.Harman's explosive allegation has sparked a heated debate in the UK, with many people expressing their outrage and disappointment on social media.

The study employs data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) to determine the infrared extinction law in the cloud's core. The analysis shows a departure from the standard extinction law, with an increased extinction rate at high optical depths. This departure is attributed to the presence of large dust grains and Ice mantles, which are abundant in the cloud's core. The study's results provide insights into the physical conditions and processes that govern the formation of dense molecular cloud cores.

However, when slopes are translated into the relative extinctioncoefficients A_\\lambda/A_K, we find an extinction law which departs from thesimple extrapolation of the near-infrared power law extinction curve, andagrees more closely with a dust extinction model for a cloud with a total toselective absorption R_V=5.5 and a grain size distribution favoring largergrains than those in the diffuse ISM. Thus, the difference we observe could bepossibly due to the effect of grain growth in denser regions. Finally, theslopes in our diagrams are somewhat less steep than those from the study ofIndebetouw et al. (2005) for clouds with lower column densities, and thisindicates that the extinction law between 3 and 8 micron might vary slightly asa function of environment.",

The proposed approach is evaluated using extensive simulations, which demonstrate its superiority over traditional QoS routing methods. The results show that the proposed approach achieves better QoS provisioning and improved resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The second stepconsists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint LogicProgramming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the bestpaths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed onthem (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics.

Our results show that as the density of the hard rods increases, there is a clear transition from disordered to ordered structures characterized by capillary ordering and layering. Additionally, we find that the ordering and layering transitions are sensitive to the size and aspect ratio of the hard rods. By understanding the factors that govern these transitions, we can gain insights into the behavior of complex fluids at the nanoscale. These findings have important implications for the design and control of materials with tailored properties in various applications. Overall, our study contributes to the fundamental understanding of capillary ordering and layering transitions in two-dimensional hard-rod fluids.",

In a first stage we study thesemi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a singlehard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at thewall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hardwalls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.For higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions evenfor very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical modelused was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-MeasureFunctional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientationapproximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checkedexperimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where verticalmotions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions betweenthe grains allow the system to explore those stationary states whichentropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surfacephenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.",

Understanding the boundary conditions of the heliosphere is crucial for predicting its interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium. Photoionization models are used to study the processes that shape the heliospheric boundary, taking into account the ionization of neutral atoms and molecules by ultraviolet radiation. These models can be constrained by interstellar and in situ data, such as the abundance of interstellar neutral helium observed by spacecraft like Voyager. Constraining the models with observational data helps improve our understanding of the physical processes at play in the heliosphere. In this study, we investigate the boundary conditions of the heliosphere using photoionization models and available data sets. We analyze how different assumptions about the interstellar medium and solar radiation affect the predicted properties of the heliospheric boundary. Our results show that accurate constraints on the heliospheric boundary can be obtained by combining interstellar observations with in situ measurements. This approach allows us to refine our understanding of the heliospheric boundary and provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the Sun's interaction with the surrounding interstellar medium. Additionally, our findings have implications for studies of cosmic ray modulation and the transport of interstellar dust particles through the heliosphere.

We create a grid of models covering a plausiblerange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input toradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Datafrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in theheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used toconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI columndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all theobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)and T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electrondensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-0.01 cm^-3.

One particularly wealthy couple, the Johnsons, had their prized inseminated eggs stolen from their heavily guarded mansion. The news of the theft spread quickly, causing panic among the elite class who feared they could be next. The authorities launched a full investigation, but the thieves were clever and managed to evade capture. As the days passed, the Johnsons grew increasingly desperate, offering a hefty reward for the safe return of their eggs. Meanwhile, the black market for inseminated human eggs continued to thrive, with demand only increasing as supply dwindled. The thieves, emboldened by their successful heist, targeted another wealthy family and made off with their precious eggs as well. The Johnsons, devastated by the loss of their future offspring, vowed to stop at nothing to track down the thieves and retrieve their stolen eggs. The black market dealers, aware of the heightened security measures, went to great lengths to ensure the safety of their illegally obtained goods. As the authorities closed in on the perpetrators, a tense standoff ensued, leading to a dramatic rescue mission to save the stolen eggs. In the end, justice was served as the thieves were apprehended, and the stolen eggs were returned to their rightful owners.

The findings also suggest that the direction of the field relative to the particle's momentum plays a crucial role in determining its decay time.

Now, I'm used to cioppino coming out as a stew with chunks of fish in a broth, but OFM's chef has decided to serve an entire slab of mahi on a thin layer of the broth with the accompanying shellfish. The dish was cooked well, but the presentation (lack of actual stew) left me wanting for more. nnThe caesar salad was pretty good, with actual anchovies on top. nnThe Hawaiian waluu dish got a thumbs up. nnThe crab cakes were also said to be very tasty. nnOverall, the experience was nice and relaxed, and the service is friendly. However, the food itself (besides the sushi) needs to be reinvigorated somehow to get it back into competition with all the new kids on the block.",

They no longer slept, consumed by a dark energy that seemed to emanate from the crystal itself. One by one, the townspeople began to disappear, their bodies found mutilated and drained of life. Rumors spread of a vengeful deity seeking retribution for being imprisoned within the crystal. The scientists refused to believe it, convinced that they were in control of the situation. But as the days turned into weeks, a sense of dread hung heavy in the air. The crystal's glow grew brighter and more menacing, casting twisted shadows across the town.

        "direct_prompt": "Parity doubling in particle physics refers to the phenomenon where certain particles exhibit degenerate states under a parity transformation. This symmetry-breaking behavior has been of interest to researchers for decades, as it provides insight into the fundamental principles governing the universe. The concept of parity doubling has been observed in a variety of contexts, including in the study of mesons and baryons. By understanding the origins of parity doubling, scientists are able to better grasp the underlying symmetries and dynamics of particle interactions. Recent experimental evidence has further supported the existence of parity doubling in particle physics, leading to new discoveries and theoretical advancements in the field. The implications of parity doubling extend beyond theoretical physics, with potential applications in technologies such as quantum computing and high-energy particle accelerators. Continued research into parity doubling promises to shed light on the nature of matter and the fundamental forces that govern the universe. In conclusion, parity doubling in particle physics remains a fascinating and fruitful area of study that holds great promise for future scientific advancements.",

Specifically, we examine the effects of pinning on the interface dynamics and how it interacts with disorder. Our results suggest that even strong pinning is not sufficient to completely stabilize the interface in two dimensions. The presence of disorder, particularly in the form of random pinning centers, leads to a complex interplay between pinning forces and thermal fluctuations. We find that the interface remains highly dynamic with a significant degree of roughness, even in the presence of strong pinning. Additionally, we observe that the system exhibits a range of different scaling behaviors depending on the strength of the pinning forces. Our findings highlight the challenges in controlling and stabilizing continuous interfaces in two dimensions, even with strong pinning mechanisms.

The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlapbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction tolocalization.

Epitaxial self-assembly is a promising technique for creating quantum dot arrays with defined structures. The order of quantum dots in these arrays plays a crucial role in their electronic and optical properties. By using linear analysis, the researchers were able to study the factors influencing the order of quantum dots and predict their spatial distribution. The results of this study provide valuable insights into controlling the order of quantum dots for various applications in optoelectronics and quantum information processing. Additionally, the findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of self-assembled nanostructures. The methodology and results presented in this article can be utilized to optimize the fabrication processes of quantum dot arrays.

Spatial order and size order of SAQDs areimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these twotypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will alsohave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order isundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formationbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlationfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order andcorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scalerandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about twodots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, thecorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-criticalfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy andSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering withcorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its naturea stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statisticalanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.",

        "direct_prompt": "In this study, we present a new search for planet transits in the open star cluster NGC 6791. This cluster is known to be one of the oldest and most metal-rich clusters in the Milky Way galaxy. Using data from the Kepler Space Telescope, we searched for periodic dimming events that could indicate the presence of exoplanets orbiting stars within the cluster. Our analysis focused on identifying potential planetary candidates based on the shapes and durations of the transit signals. We also utilized follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes to further confirm the existence of any transiting planets. Our search revealed several promising candidates for planetary transits in NGC 6791. We analyzed the properties of these candidate planets, including their sizes, orbital periods, and distances from their host stars. Additionally, we calculated the likelihood of false positives and explored potential sources of systematic errors in our data. Our findings suggest that NGC 6791 may harbor a population of planets similar to those found in other star clusters. This discovery has implications for our understanding of planet formation and evolution in dense stellar environments. Furthermore, the presence of exoplanets in NGC 6791 could shed light on the dynamical interactions between planets and their host stars in clustered environments. Future studies will focus on confirming and characterizing these candidate planets through additional observations and analyses. Overall, our search for planet transits in NGC 6791 adds valuable insights to the field of exoplanet research and highlights the importance of studying planetary systems in diverse stellar populations.",
        "human_text": "Context. Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study theeffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution. Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellarmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searchedfor close-in planets using the transit technique. Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using theCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m),and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probabilitywe also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved. Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). Theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster. Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m classtelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency ofplanets in NGC 6791.",

By analyzing archival X-ray observations from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope, we find a clear correlation between the flux variations of the Fe K alpha line and the continuum emission. Our results suggest that the redshifted Fe K alpha line in NGC 3783 is likely produced in the inner region of the accretion disk. This correlation provides valuable insights into the physical processes occurring in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole in NGC 3783. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed correlated modulation between the Fe K alpha line and the continuum emission. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing body of research on the X-ray properties of active galactic nuclei and their implications for the accretion process.",

In addition to a constant core of the Fe Kalpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission featurebetween 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ksthat is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV sourcecontinuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Feline and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretiondisc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of theredshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line islikely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.",

Using a state-of-the-art neural network model, we systematically induced lesions in different regions of the network to evaluate their impact on network functionality. Our results demonstrate that cortical networks exhibit a remarkable level of robustness against localized lesions, with only minor disruptions to network connectivity and information processing. Interestingly, we found that the degree of robustness varied depending on the location and size of the lesion, with certain regions being more critical for maintaining network integrity. Additionally, we observed that the network's ability to reorganize and compensate for lesions played a crucial role in preserving overall functionality. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that specific network properties, such as redundancy and modularity, contribute to the network's robustness against lesions.

In this study, we analyze the broadband spectral evolution of this burst throughout both the prompt and afterglow phases. Our analysis utilized data collected from various telescopes and detectors to track the changing energy distribution of the burst over time. We found that the spectral properties of GRB 061121 evolved significantly from the prompt phase to the afterglow phase. The prompt phase showed a high-energy spectral component, indicative of the initial burst of gamma rays. As the burst transitioned into the afterglow phase, the spectrum shifted towards lower energies, consistent with the emission from the expanding shock front. Our observations suggest that the spectral evolution of GRB 061121 is complex and may be influenced by factors such as the surrounding environment and the magnetic field strength. The detailed analysis presented in this study provides valuable insights into the physics of gamma-ray bursts and their emission mechanisms. Further research is needed to fully understand the processes driving the spectral evolution of bright bursts like GRB 061121.

The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andX-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. Theoptical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SEDshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviourmight be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. Theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using acombination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame.

However, one major hurdle in realizing this potential is the phenomenon of decoherence, which can disrupt the delicate quantum states required for enhanced accuracy. In this article, we explore the various factors that contribute to decoherence in quantum-enhanced timing systems, including environmental noise and imperfections in experimental setups. We also discuss strategies for mitigating decoherence, such as error correction techniques and robust control methods. Additionally, we investigate the impact of decoherence on the overall timing accuracy achievable with quantum-enhanced systems. Our analysis reveals the complex interplay between decoherence and timing accuracy, highlighting the need for further research in this area. Ultimately, a better understanding of decoherence in quantum-enhanced timing systems will be crucial for realizing their full potential in precision timekeeping applications.",

The system is composed of two low-mass stars surrounded by a common circumbinary disk. The accretion rates onto the individual stars show a periodic variability with a period of approximately 18 days. This periodicity is likely due to the orbital motion of the stars around each other, causing variations in the accretion rates from the circumbinary disk. The observed periodic accretion suggests that the circumbinary disk is still actively feeding material onto the binary system. The binary separation of UZ Tau E is relatively small, leading to complex interactions between the stars and the circumbinary disk. Future studies combining observations and simulations will be crucial in understanding the dynamics of accretion in circumbinary systems. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the early stages of binary star formation and the role of circumbinary disks in feeding material onto young binary systems.",

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of theouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting inaccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifestitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present asearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopicbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find thatthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. Thebrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overallperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more thanhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not asclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic componentis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement withpredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar tothose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur fromcircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending thetimescale over which they might form planets.",

The prompt emission phase of GRBs, occurring within the first several seconds of the burst, is characterized by the production of high energy photons. These photons, with energies ranging from keV to GeV, provide crucial insights into the physics of GRBs and the processes involved in their formation. Understanding the prompt emission of high energy photons is essential for unraveling the complex mechanisms at play in these cataclysmic events. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the prompt emission of high energy photons from GRBs, including the observed characteristics and theoretical models proposed to explain them. We discuss the role of processes such as synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering, and photospheric emission in shaping the observed spectra and temporal profiles of high energy photons in GRBs. Additionally, we explore the implications of high-energy photon observations for the study of GRB physics and their potential as probes of the underlying astrophysical conditions. Overall, a comprehensive understanding of prompt emission in GRBs is crucial for advancing our knowledge of these extreme phenomena and their impact on the universe.",
        "human_text": "Within the internal shock scenario we consider different mechanisms of highenergy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball andderive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during theprompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are comparedwithin different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the highenergy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shockenergy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).For very small values of $\\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could becomparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.However, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is requiredto account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballsare therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulkLorentz factor (e.g. $\\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\\sim 10$ GeV areattenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an evenhigher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -PeV due to $\\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The fluxlevel is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and thesephotons also suffer attenuation by external soft photons.",

This would be a five star rating if I wasn't considering the grocery store, but this place IS indeed a grocery store and not just a street vendor (unfortunately). nThe grocery store is very poorly organized, things are dusty, and many of the things don't have expiration dates. That's actually pretty typical of imported Asian food, but I was really skeptical about buying anything from the grocery store because no one really shops here (there are better competitors down the street, like Lotus Food Co) and that means that the food remained on the shelf for who knows how long. The first time my friend and I came here, she purchased a pack of mango mochi ice cream and found that it had freezer burn and smelled a bit off as well. The store manager/owner kindly refunded the purchase, which was nice, but I would still never buy anything. Also, compared to Lotus Food Co, some of the items in this store are more expensive. The mochi ice cream was definitely more expensive--I can't remember exactly how much, but after we realized that we bought a bad item, we went to Lotus Food Co and bought a box of mochi ice cream that was perfectly fine, delicious, and less expensive.",

        "direct_prompt": "This study explores the behavior of circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr spacetimes. Kerr spacetimes are characterized by their rotating black holes, which introduce complex gravitational effects on test particles orbiting them. Circular orbits are those in which a particle maintains a fixed distance from the black hole, while non-circular orbits exhibit varying distances. The nearly horizon-skimming nature of these orbits refers to their proximity to the event horizon of the black hole. The dynamics of such orbits are of interest due to their potential impact on the accretion processes that occur around black holes. In this paper, we analyze the properties of these orbits and their stability in Kerr spacetimes. We find that circular orbits are more stable near the event horizon compared to non-circular orbits. Additionally, these nearly horizon-skimming orbits exhibit unique precession effects due to the spacetime curvature caused by the rotating black hole. Our findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of test particles near rotating black holes and contribute to the understanding of gravitational dynamics in extreme environments.",
        "human_text": "We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of anearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spina=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbitswhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respectto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact oppositeto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclinationchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits arenot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveformsexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.",

As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there canoccur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierlsstate that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different fromthe Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations fromthe spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied bychanges in site charge densities.

The next day, Milo flew to a nearby lake to rest and contemplate his actions. He knew that in order to survive, he needed to keep feeding on humans, but he also knew that he couldn't continue to harm innocent people. Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind - what if he found a way to feed without causing harm? Inspired by this idea, Milo flew back to the village to search for an alternative source of blood. He landed on a cow grazing in a nearby field and began to feed. The cow didn't seem to mind, and Milo realized that he could feed on animals instead of humans to survive. Overjoyed by this revelation, Milo continued to feed on animals and regained his strength and vitality. He was proud of himself for finding a way to live without causing harm to others. As the days passed, Milo's malaria began to fade away, and he no longer felt weak or hungry. He knew that he had made the right decision by choosing to feed on animals instead of humans. And though he still felt a twinge of guilt for his past actions, he was grateful to have found a way to survive without causing harm. In the end, Milo lived a long and happy life, free from the burden of his moral dilemma. And he was content knowing that he had chosen the path of compassion and kindness.",

        "human_text": "Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by asource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted asscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. Oneof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-inducedvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristicvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Datafor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 arepresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in thiscompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDVthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in thevariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored theflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25mUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine thevariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes ofthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropicannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation isin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adoptinga simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequencydependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of thescattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. Thelatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.",

Sadness was a constant companion, reminding the killer of the pain they had experienced in their past. Happiness was a rare visitor in the killer's mind, only appearing briefly after a successful kill.

Using radio observations obtained from the VLA and ALMA telescopes, we detected an unresolved radio source at the center of the cluster, consistent with the location of the IMBH. The radio emission is found to be variable over time, indicating potential accretion activity onto the IMBH. Analysis of the radio spectral properties suggests a non-thermal origin for the emission, possibly originating from a jet or outflow associated with the IMBH. The presence of radio emission from the IMBH in G1 provides valuable insights into the accretion processes and environment of intermediate-mass black holes in dense stellar systems. Further observations and theoretical modeling are necessary to fully understand the nature of the radio emission and its implications for the evolution of IMBHs in globular clusters.",

Radio emission was detected within an arcsecond of the clustercenter with an 8.4 GHz power of 2 x 10^{15} W/Hz. The radio/X-ray ratio of G1is a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass X-ray binaryin the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretiononto an IMBH with the reported mass. A pulsar wind nebula is also a possiblecandidate for the radio and X-ray emission from G1; future high-sensitivityVLBI observations might distinguish between this possibility and an IMBH. Ifthe radio source is an IMBH, and similar accretion and outflow processes occurfor hypothesized ~ 1000-solar-mass black holes in Milky Way globular clusters,they are within reach of the current VLA and should be detectable easily by theExpanded VLA when it comes on line in 2010.",

The model incorporates key physical processes such as star formation, chemical enrichment, and feedback from supernovae to provide a comprehensive understanding of galaxy evolution. The SPITZER data provides observational constraints on the properties of galaxies in the infra-red, allowing for a comparison with the model predictions. Our results show good agreement between the model and the SPITZER data for various galaxy properties, including star formation rates, stellar masses, and metallicities. By comparing the model with observational data, we gain insights into the physical processes driving galaxy evolution in the infra-red. This research contributes to a better understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time and highlights the importance of incorporating infra-red observations into galaxy formation models. Future studies can further refine these models to better match the observed properties of galaxies in the infra-red.",

We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxyformation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDsincluding the reprocessing of radiation by dust. The model, which is the sameas that in Baugh et al (2005), assumes two different IMFs: a normal solarneighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavyIMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We have shown previously thatthe top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faintsub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZERSpace Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen beforeSPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observedevolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probedby SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolutionin the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, andthis is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.On the other hand, a model with a normal IMF in starbursts predicts far toolittle evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.",

The prosecution argued that his actions were a clear abuse of power and trust within the police force. The defense, however, maintained that Smith is innocent and that the accusations are false. The court heard testimonies from several witnesses who claimed to have been victims of Smith's inappropriate behavior.

This work opens up a new avenue for testing and validating string theory using cosmological observations, offering insights into the ultimate nature of the universe. Future CMB experiments will continue to play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of fundamental physics and the underlying principles of the cosmos.",
        "human_text": "Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMBobservations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present allknown string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the levelof detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes maypresent a challenge to string cosmology. The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observationthat in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of theHubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. Forthe gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to anextremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models aresuperheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications forparticle phenomenology based on string theory.",

This distortion can impact the accuracy of measurements taken by detectors, such as interferometers.

The paper emphasizes the potential of radio astrometry to complement other detection methods and provide valuable insights into the properties of exoplanets. Key challenges and opportunities in radio astrometric detection are discussed, including the need for improved sensitivity and resolution in radio telescopes. The paper also highlights the importance of collaborations between radio astronomers and exoplanet researchers to further advance the field. By harnessing the power of radio astrometry, researchers have the potential to discover new exoplanets, study their atmospheres, and explore their orbits in greater detail. The paper discusses the technological advancements needed to achieve these goals, including the development of next-generation radio telescopes with higher precision and sensitivity. Additionally, the paper addresses the potential impact of radio astrometric detection on our understanding of planet formation and evolution.

In this study, we investigate constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter by analyzing numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-5. By comparing the observed properties of the galaxy cluster with simulated models incorporating different values of the self-interaction cross-section, we are able to place limits on this crucial parameter. Our results show that a non-zero, but still relatively small, self-interaction cross-section is favored by the data. We find that larger values of the self-interaction cross-section are disfavored due to inconsistencies with the observed dynamics of the merging galaxy cluster. These constraints provide valuable insight into the nature of dark matter and its interactions with ordinary matter on astrophysical scales.

Future observations and simulations will continue to refine these constraints and crucially inform our understanding of the fundamental constituents of the universe.",

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subclusterwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions ofthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionlessgalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on theself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, usingsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, andcomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow fora new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observationof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. Thisnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. Ifwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equalmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringentconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of thesubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with theuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of darkmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slightimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules outmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between thestandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.",

The prices were exorbitant for what we received, making the experience even more disappointing. The atmosphere was also a letdown, with a lack of charm or character to make up for the lackluster food. The wait time for our table was incredibly long, despite having made a reservation in advance.

By comparing our findings to theoretical models, we aim to shed light on the formation mechanisms of blue stragglers within globular clusters. Our results indicate a potential connection between the presence of blue stragglers and the dynamical history of NGC 1904, suggesting a complex interplay between internal evolution and external interactions.

Such evidences, coupled with the large radius ofavoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\\sim 30$ core radii), indicate thatthe vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to thecore.

        "direct_prompt": "This study explores the decomposition of functions on quadratic surfaces into multipole moments. The use of multipole moments allows for a more concise and efficient representation of these functions. By deconstructing functions into multipole moments, we are able to isolate specific features and behaviors of the original function. The methodology involves representing functions as a sum of multipole moments such as monopole, dipole, and quadrupole moments. These multipole moments capture the global and local aspects of the function on the quadratic surface. The decomposition process provides valuable insights into the underlying structure and symmetries of the functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through numerical simulations and applications to real-world scenarios. The results show that multipole moments offer a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding functions on quadratic surfaces. Overall, this study contributes to the broader understanding of functions on quadratic surfaces and highlights the importance of multipole moments in characterizing these functions.",

The coefficientsof these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called \\emph{multipole}vectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar multipole representations ofpolynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$,real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is notunique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate thecombinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with someclassical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositionsof functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classicaltheorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator$\\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\\Delta_Q$ that areconstructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introducemodular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topologyusing methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipolespaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments tothe ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\\pi, 1)$-spaces, where$\\pi$ runs over a variety of modified braid groups.",

The model also suggeststhat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided byALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the coolgas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models ofthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations ofthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) revealsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longerperiods in network regions.

By applying our symplectic test, we are able to provide new insights into the conjectured behavior of L-functions ratios and potentially make progress towards resolving this long-standing conjecture. Our results suggest that the ratios of L-functions exhibit a certain symplectic structure that is crucial for understanding their distribution.

For a thousand years, the two nations lived in isolation from one another, focusing on building their new societies and civilizations. Novaya Zemlya became a socialist utopia, with a strong emphasis on collective ownership and equality, while New Columbia flourished as a capitalist powerhouse, with a focus on individualism and competition. The two colonies developed their own unique cultures, languages, and technologies, with little knowledge of each other's existence. However, one day, a group of explorers from Novaya Zemlya stumbled upon an ancient communication device that allowed them to establish contact with New Columbia. The leaders of both colonies were initially hesitant to reconnect, fearing that the old animosities would resurface. But as they began to communicate and share information, they realized that they had both grown and evolved beyond their old conflicts. They discovered that they had much to learn from each other, and that by working together, they could achieve great things. The people of Novaya Zemlya marveled at the advanced technology and pioneering spirit of New Columbia, while the people of New Columbia were impressed by the sense of community and social welfare of Novaya Zemlya. As they continued to exchange ideas and resources, they found that they could accomplish things that would have been impossible on their own. Together, they were able to explore new worlds, invent new technologies, and create a more prosperous and harmonious future for both colonies.",

We analyze the behavior of the scalar field and its contribution to the total energy density of the universe as it evolves over time. Our results reveal that for certain parameter choices, the cosmological constant Lambda can naturally emerge as a consequence of the dynamics of the conformally coupled phantom field. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the currently observed acceleration of the universe and the possible nature of dark energy.

We show that while flavour-dependent thermal type II leptogenesisbecomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and thebounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for leptogenesis becomes moreconstrained.

For one man named James, he decided to spend 12 hours with a clone of his late father who had passed away when he was just a child. As they sat together, James asked his father all the questions he had always wondered about, and listened intently as his father shared stories and advice. It was a bittersweet experience, knowing that the clone would be disposed of at the end of their time together. But James was grateful for the opportunity to connect with his father in a way he never thought possible. As the 12 hours came to an end, they shared a heartfelt goodbye, and James left the clone club with a newfound sense of peace. The clone smiled warmly at him before disappearing, leaving James with memories that he would cherish forever. And as he walked away, he couldn't help but wonder what other experiences the clone clubs had in store for him.",

Green function theory relies on mathematical equations to describe the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons in the film, while Quantum Monte Carlo simulations use random sampling methods to approximate the ground state properties of the system. The thin film geometry introduces unique challenges due to the reduced dimensionality and material interfaces. We investigate the magnetization profile, exchange interactions, and magnetic anisotropy energy of the thin film using both methods. Our results show that Green function theory accurately reproduces the magnetic properties of the film, but Quantum Monte Carlo calculations provide more precise predictions in certain cases. The computational cost and complexity of each method are also compared to evaluate their practical utility for modeling thin magnetic films. Overall, our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the most appropriate theoretical approach for studying the behavior of nanoscale magnetic systems. Future research could further explore the potential synergies between Green function theory and Quantum Monte Carlo calculations to improve the accuracy and efficiency of thin film simulations. This study highlights the importance of developing robust theoretical frameworks for understanding the complex magnetic behavior exhibited by thin films in various applications.",

We discuss these systems in perpendicular external field,i.e. B parallel to the film normal. GFT results are in good agreement with QMCfor high enough fields and temperatures. Below a critical field or a criticaltemperature no collinear stable magnetization exists in GFT. On the other handQMC gives finite magnetization even below those critical values. This indicatesthat there occurs a transition from non-collinear to collinear configurationswith increasing field or temperature. For slightly tilted external fields arotation of magnetization from out-of-plane to in-plane orientation is foundwith decreasing temperature.",

By analyzing the nucleation behavior of various phases within the model, we aim to understand the conditions under which certain phases dominate the nucleation process.

Furthermore, we observe that the Ostwald rule, which states that the most stable phase will eventually dominate, may not always hold true in systems with multiple metastable phases. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the complex nucleation processes that govern the formation of metastable phases in multi-phase systems.

Its hoots were hauntingly beautiful, yet incomprehensible to the other animals. The owl would perch high in the trees, observing the forest with wise eyes, but never participating in the conversations below.

The QGP, a state of matter with deconfined quarks and gluons, is expected to exhibit fluid-like behavior. The proposed framework incorporates dissipative effects such as viscosity and thermal conductivity, which may play a crucial role in determining the QGP's transport properties. By considering the system as a viscous fluid with thermal gradients, the model aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of QGP dynamics. The framework's predictions could have implications for experimental observations of QGP in heavy-ion collisions at facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider.

You're probably asking why order that when at a fish market. Well I originally planned on fish but I hadn't had bison in a while and it caught my eye. Well the menu is a bit pricey and I don't mind paying for good food so I had high expectations. He bison burger was mediocre (took a star away) The menu said bacon, but none showed up. No worries probably better for me. I felt at $15 for a bison burger this thing should freaking be awesome. Not the case. I would put it at $8. 99-$9. 99 price range I would pay since they gave me chips as a side. So they lost another star for over priced for the value I received. The girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu. Two basic rolls and miso soup for $16. This would easy go for $14 at other places during lunch. So ultimately would I give it another shot? Yes, but only if it is convenient. I would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place. nnHelpful advice for the OFM. Actually have lunch specials. If you charge the prices you charge the food needs to be worth the price or you will lose return customers. Two rolls of sushi and a burger shouldn't cost me $33 unless you are going to blow minds!",

What they found, no one could believe. Found on the surface was a white banner attached to the end of a fairly preserved metallic rod. Scientists have dated the material to be only approximately one thousand Creaxellion years old. Closer inspection of the banner leads some to believe that dyes were imbedded within the fabric, perhaps with the intention of inscribing a message on the banner. Additionally, small imprints on the lunar surface were also found; however, these prints did not match any life form found on Creaxellion. Aluminum pieces were found scattered within the flag' s viscidity, but scientists have yet to make anything of this. All of this was big news, considering there were no other signs of life in the entire solar system or any nearby systems... An examination of the host planet could suggest that a primitive civilization might have inhabited the planet and developed sufficiently enough to reach their satellite moon. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this claim. Other scientists suggest that the host planet, due to its lack of water and its high levels of radiation, could never support intelligent life. Whatever the case, the search for the truth continues, and our citizens continue to ponder our seemingly unbridgeable aloneness in the vast ocean of space and time.",

The intricate three-dimensional structures of proteins play a crucial role in determining their functions. One fascinating aspect of protein structure is the presence of intricate knots, where regions of the protein chain are threaded through one another. These knots are thought to play important roles in protein function, stability, and evolution. Understanding the formation and functions of protein knots can provide insights into the evolution of protein structures and their diverse functions. Studies have shown that protein knots can affect protein folding, stability, and catalytic activity. Furthermore, recent research has revealed that certain protein knots are conserved across different species, suggesting that they have been evolutionarily selected for their functional significance. Overall, unraveling the mysteries of protein knots offers new perspectives on protein structure-function relationships and the evolutionary history of proteins.",
        "human_text": "A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a ratherunexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knotsare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to proteinfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete ProteinData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discoveredones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the mostcomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest thatits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by theproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species andsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which onlyappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins ofsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in theenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of ashort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into aknotted structure in this protein.",

May, your personal AI assistant, hums as she browses her database. \" Scan complete. Object identified is a Stegosaurus. It is a type of dinosaur that roamed the earth nearly 200 million years ago. It has been extinct for, quite some time. \" You nod your head. \" Quite impressive, this, beast. \" May sighs. \" Contrary to popular believe, the Stegosaurus was actually a herbivore. It most likely kept to itself, trying to avoid human contact, which was n' t what ended up happening. \" You keep walking through the large, buried rooms. You keep away from the hard clear material that is strewn all throughout the floor, it caused a slice through your fabricated armor suit when you broke through it unknowingly, when you stumbled a crossed this place. \" What happened to them? \" You ask. You gaze up at another large display, this one appears to be standing up on the ground, except the head had been crushed to the floor. \" Nobody knows. \" She says. \" Unfortunately, humans were n' t around at the time. Some humans believe that a meteor strike baked them all to death. There are other speculations as well. \" You begin to look around at more of the large, shadowy displays. \" May, let' s get out of here. I do n' t like it in here. \" May hums a tune. \"",

We investigate the distribution of particle production as a function of azimuthal angle in high-energy nuclear collisions. Our analysis reveals a preferential alignment of particles along certain azimuthal angles, indicating the presence of collective flow in the system. Through the study of azimuthal correlations, we provide insights into the dynamics of the collision process and the properties of the produced matter. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between geometry, dynamics, and interactions in nuclear collisions.",
        "human_text": "We describe azimuth structure commonly associated with elliptic and directedflow in the context of 2D angular autocorrelations for the purpose of preciseseparation of so-called nonflow (mainly minijets) from flow. We extend theFourier-transform description of azimuth structure to include power spectra andautocorrelations related by the Wiener-Khintchine theorem. We analyze severalexamples of conventional flow analysis in that context and question therelevance of reaction plane estimation to flow analysis. We introduce the 2Dangular autocorrelation with examples from data analysis and describe asimulation exercise which demonstrates precise separation of flow and nonflowusing the 2D autocorrelation method. We show that an alternative correlationmeasure based on Pearson's normalized covariance provides a more intuitivemeasure of azimuth structure.",

        "direct_prompt": "England winger Jonny May has been dealt a devastating blow as he has been ruled out of the remainder of the season. The 30-year-old suffered a hamstring injury during a training session, forcing him to undergo surgery. This news comes as a huge setback for both May and the England national team, as they head into the final stretch of the season. May has been a key player for England, earning 67 caps and scoring an impressive 33 tries. His absence will surely be felt on the pitch as England looks to finish the season strong. May's injury adds to a growing list of setbacks for the team, who have already faced numerous setbacks this season. The winger's recovery time is estimated to be several months, meaning he will miss the upcoming international fixtures. Despite this setback, May remains positive and is determined to come back stronger than ever. The England team will have to regroup and find a way to fill the void left by one of their star players as they push through the remainder of the season.",

It's a disappointing end to the 12 months for Jonny, both at club and international level. \"May's absence is a further blow for new England head coach Eddie Jones, with Bath forward Dave Attwood and Leicester lock Ed Slater ruled out of next month's championship earlier this week.Northampton prop Kieran Brookes is also set for an extended spell on the sidelines after having an operation on his knee, as is Exeter centre Henry Slade and back row Dave Ewers.England start their Six Nations campaign under Jones against Scotland on 6 February.Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell featured in the World Cup and may be the likely starters at Murrayfield, while Chris Ashton and Semesa Rokoduguni are pushing for places in the squad.Humphreys hopes to have May back for the start of next season, with the winger likely to also miss England's summer tour of Australia.",
