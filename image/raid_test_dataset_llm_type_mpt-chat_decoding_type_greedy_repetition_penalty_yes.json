A full overlap in real space of wave functions of two conduction\nelectrons leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus, the exchange interaction\ncauses a bond between two conduction electrons in real space. The singlet bond\nis possible because the singlet electrons can simultaneously and permanently\noccupy one spatial ground state, so the average energy of paired electrons is\nlower than the energy of unpaired electrons. Thus, the pairing is a result of\nthe Pauli Exclusion Principle. If conduction electrons, before pairing, are put\non the Fermi surface in the momentum space, then every pair may exist\npermanently in time. The motion of conduction electrons in the crystal may\nprevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion\nis usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. Conduction electrons as\nstanding waves are local and have zero momenta, hence their momenta are\nsynchronous; therefore, weak singlet bonds are stable despite the large kinetic\nenergy on the Fermi surface. The local pairing of standing waves explains the\ninverse isotope effect, Tc-dome, insulator-superconductor transitions and many\nother facts about superconductors. The electron pairs, as bosons, can form a\nmacroscopically coherent Bose-Einstein-Condensate and, thus, become\nnon-dissipative and non-local.\n",

The Band managed to fend off the crows but at the cost of Digger being injured. After landing in a tree for shelter, a neighbouring family of Masked Owls came to visit. Before leaving, the female Masked Owl became skeptical when she heard that \"The Band\" was on the way to find the Guardians of Gahoole. Later after their departure from the spruce tree, they stayed in a sycamore with a couple of Sooty Owls named Sweetums and Swatums who supported The Band in their quest to find Ga'Hoole. In the Beaks, a barren and desolate area, \"The Band\" ventured into a dark cave where they were attacked by a bobcat. Together, \"The Band\" managed to kill the bobcat and upon further investigation they found a dying Barred Owl. When they asked if St.Aggie's had attacked him, his last words were, \"Oh! You only wish!\" After hearing this disturbing news, The Band continued on their quest. However, their progress would be dangerously hindered because of the Mirror Lakes. Their gleaming surfaces hypnotized The Band and made them content to stay and put off their quest. Eventually Mrs. Plithiver recognized the danger and stirred The Band into remembrance of their quest. When they left, they were blown off course straight into the Ice Narrows in the Northern Kingdoms where they were taken in by a family of puffins: the oddest creatures \"The Band\" had ever seen. Despite all difficulties, \"The Band\" were escorted to the Island of Hoole by the Snowy Owl monarchs of the tree, Boron and Barran. Upon their arrival to the Great Ga'Hoole Tree, a stuck-up Spotted Owl named Otulissa escorted \"The Band\" to their new hollow. They learned from her that they could not just go into a battle but that skills must be learned by becoming members of chaws: specialized groups of owls that dedicate themselves to a certain skill. Despite finding Ga'Hoole, \"The Band\" sought a meeting with the parliament because they felt that their knowledge of St. Aggie's would be valuable to the Guardians. However, Boron informed \"The Band\" that they needed to wait a bit longer and that nobility wasn't garnered instantly but through unwavering resolution and stalwartness. He also informed them that their journey had not ended when they arrived at the tree but it had only just begun and that they would begin their training the next day. During the day, Soren found Twilight thinking about leaving the Guardians because \"The Band\" would be broken up because they would be separated into chaws. Soren reassured Twilight that no matter what happened that they would always be a band. Upon hearing these words, Twilight decided to stay. As time passed, \"The Band\" learned many skills and became more accustomed to life at the tree. However, Soren was still haunted by the thought of his sister Eglantine and her well-being. Eventually, The Band were placed into their respective chaws; Soren was placed into the colliering and weather chaws. This was a disaster for Soren because of the Whiskered Screech Owl Ezylryb's intimidating missing talon and because he was double chawed with Otulissa whose talkative attitude proved to be hard to bear. However, the blacksmith of the Great Ga'Hoole Tree, Bubo (a Great Horned Owl) was confident that Soren would be all that he could be because Ezylryb had recognized Soren's potential. Later, \"The Band\" discovered that the roots under the parliament chamber were prone to transmitting any sound created in the chamber. This allowed them to discover that the Guardians were addressing the topic concerning the dead Barred Owl. They found out that he was a slipgizzle: an owl spy that worked for the Guardians. Eventually Soren's fears and problems began to subside. Ezylryb proved to be much more than every owl in his weather chaw ever thought him to be. Soren was even able to help Mrs. Plithiver get a spot in the harp guild with Madame Plonke, the tree's beloved snowy owl singer. Soren also managed to catch a burning coal in his beak and earned Ezylryb's rare approval. Owlets of the Tyto species were found dropped all over babbling nonsense about owl purity. Digger and Twilight, who were part of the search and rescue chaw, found Eglantine who was one of the owlets dropped in the event that came to be known as the Great Downing. Soren was shocked when he was shown Eglantine but disappointed that she wasn't her true self. Eventually, Trader Mags came to trade goods at the Great Ga'Hoole Tree and Eglantine went into a panic when shown a piece of isinglass. This panic, however, proved to be effective because Eglantine broke out of her strange condition and became normal once again. For now, Soren felt content but only to an extent since Ezylryb, the ryb Soren had come to truly cherish, had not yet returned from his investigations of the Great Downing.",

It says the programme breaches editorial guidelines. The group's members met with Sky executives on Tuesday after viewing previews of the first five episodes. The drama, now in its fourth series, begins on Sunday evening. The new series portrays a Muslim family as a sleeper terrorist cell. The Muslim Council of Britain said in a statement: \"We are greatly concerned by the unremittingly hostile and unbalanced portrayal of Muslims in this series of 24 based upon a preview of the first five episodes that we have seen.\" \"There is not a single positive Muslim character in the storyline to date. At a time when negative stereotypes of Muslims are on the increase we feel that Sky - as a major UK broadcaster - has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views, not help to reinforce them.\" But Sky denied the programme breached broadcasting guidelines. A spokesperson said: \"During a useful meeting yesterday, Sky listened to the concerns raised by representatives of the council. Sky does not believe that the episodes that it has reviewed to date breach Ofcom's programme code.\" Fox TV, which shows the series in the US, is broadcasting public service announcements showing Muslims in a positive light after complaints about the series.",
        "direct_prompt": "A prominent Muslim advocacy organization has criticized the popular American television series '24' for its portrayal of Muslims as terrorists, in a statement released on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on Fox Network to stop airing the show and denounced it as promoting Islamophobia.\n\nThe council cited several scenes from recent episodes where characters with Middle Eastern backgrounds were shown engaging in violent acts or supporting terrorism. In one scene, a character is heard saying that he would rather die than live under Islamic rule.\n\n\"Such depictions contribute to an atmosphere of hatred towards Muslims,\" said Ibrahim Hooper, CAIR's national communications director. He added that such stereotypes can lead to violence against innocent people who happen to be Muslim.\n\nFox Networks issued a statement defending the show, which is known for its fast-paced action and dramatic plot twists. A spokesperson for the network stated that '24' is a work of fiction and should not be taken as reflective of real life. However, they acknowledged that some viewers may find certain aspects of the program offensive.\n\nThis is not the first time that '24' has come under fire for its depiction of Muslims. In previous seasons, characters have been portrayed as part of a terrorist cell planning attacks on US soil. Critics argue that these representations reinforce negative stereotypes about Islam and fan the flames of anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nIn response to the criticism, '24' creator Joel Surnow defended the show, stating that it portrays all religions equally negatively and that the goal is to entertain, not promote any particular ideology. However, many observers believe that the impact of media representation cannot be underestimated, especially in today's climate of heightened tension between Western nations and radical Islamist groups.\n\nThe controversy over '24' highlights the delicate balance between artistic expression and social responsibility. While creators have the right to depict whatever scenarios they choose, they must also recognize the potential consequences of their choices. As tensions continue to rise both within and outside the United States, it remains to be seen whether shows like '24' will continue to perpetuate harmful myths and misconceptions about entire religious communities.",

STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers -- but the nine and ten- star reviews are all getting pelted with \"negative\" marks, earning scores of \"1 out of 15\" likes.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? The problem is that this movie wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the story of young black men facing oppression and coming out on top. The American people were not supposed to see the real truth about how their police treat minorities every day. <br/><br/>Quick, let's bury the good reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's dead, and young black men are okay once they're dead. The dead ones are no longer scary and threatening. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually dared to portray young, angry black men as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, because Hollywood was built on that. From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. But you can't do that with black men who rap about crime, even when they aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible!<br/><br/>There are very powerful elements in this country that are terribly frightened by this movie. They're frightened because this movie gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than dangerous criminals. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by police are a terrible threat to the powerful elements in our society, who stay in power only by keeping white people scared of black men. They can't tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals.<br/><br/>I say this is a good movie, a powerful, exciting film that presents a side of American life that is almost never seen on the screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but what the hell. <br/><br/>I've got enough already.",

        "human_text": "The US looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve.\nMinutes of the December meeting which pushed rates up to 2.25% showed that policy-makers at the Fed are worried about accelerating inflation. The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares. \"The markets are starting to fear a more aggressive Fed in 2005,\" said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research. The Dow Jones index dropped almost 100 points on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades. The dollar also gained ground against sterling on Tuesday, reaching $1.8832 to the pound before slipping slightly on Wednesday morning.\nThe release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 December meeting was much faster than usual, indicating the Fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking. This, too, is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come. The key Fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. That long trough \"might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets\", said the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates. The odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early February, economists said. But the respite for the dollar, which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive US trade and budget deficits, may be short-lived. \"You can't rule out a further correction... but we don't think it's a change in direction in the dollar,\" said Jason Daw at Merrill Lynch. \"Nothing fundamental has changed.\"",
        "direct_prompt": "The Federal Reserve has signalled that it plans to continue raising interest rates, despite growing concerns about the impact on the US economy.\n\nIn its latest policy statement, the central bank said that it expected inflation to remain above its 2% target in the coming years, and that further increases in the benchmark federal funds rate would be necessary.\n\nWhile acknowledging some weakening in global economic growth, the Fed stressed that it still saw strong labour market conditions and rising wages as justification for continuing with its tightening cycle.\n\nHowever, stock markets reacted negatively to the announcement, with investors worried about the potential impact on corporate profits and consumer spending.\n\nSome economists have criticised the Fed's decision, arguing that continued rate hikes could lead to a slowdown in economic growth and potentially trigger a recession.\n\nBut Chairperson Jerome Powell defended the move, saying that the central bank was simply following through on its previously stated plan to gradually normalize monetary policy after the crisis-era stimulus measures were unwound.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Fed will indeed proceed with another hike at its next meeting in December, or whether mounting pressure from politicians and financial analysts will cause it to pause and reassess its strategy.",

        "human_text": "Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets.\nIn most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now. But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street. Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as \"HD\", but are in fact not able to display HD.\n\"The UK is the largest display market in Europe,\" according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets.\nBut, he added: \"Of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the UK are capable of getting high-definition.\" There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. Part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the High Street, say industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit last week. \"We have to be careful about consumer confusion. There is a massive education process to go through,\" said Mr Binks. The industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. Eventually, that will be everyone. The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.\nPreparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with HD cameras. BSkyB plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes, to receive HDTV broadcasts, in time for Christmas. Like its Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (PVRs). The company will start broadcasts of HDTV programmes, offering them as \"premium channel packages\", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be \"real\". By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory.\nBut it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to \"being digital\". As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. Part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. But it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for.\nFrom next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a \"HD-Ready\" sticker. This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. \"The logo is absolutely the way forward,\" said David Mercer, analysts with Strategy Analytics. \"But it is still not appearing on many retail products.\" The industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. \"We can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers,\" said Mr Oudendijk. \"There may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months.\" The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line. It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats. \"We believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,\" said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the \"true impact\" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice. What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe. The prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.",
        "direct_prompt": "The race to be the dominant force in high-definition television has left consumers and industry experts alike scratching their heads as they try to make sense of conflicting standards, incompatible equipment and murky marketing claims.\n\nWhile Japan's Blu-ray Disc Association boasts that its HD DVD format is poised to become the standard for next generation video discs, Toshiba Corp., one of the key backers ofHD DVD, announced last week it would stop making playersfor the technology by March 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony Corporation continues to pushits own Blu-ray discformat, which was approvedas thehigh definitionstandardby Hollywood studioslast year.

I have been married to someone else for the last 7 years and now have a 2nd son. My current household has been very strict about quarantining. We follow CDC guidelines very strictly and have chosen not to gather with people if it isn’t necessary. My ex, however, is in the camp of people that dismiss the guidelines and her household is taking much more risk than ours is. She recently tested positive for COVID-19 the Monday after one of my 12 year old’s weekends with me. Generally given timelines my 12 year old could have been exposed and passed it to our family. The trouble I have is, after this situation, I told my ex that I expect her to tell me when someone in her household is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 if around a weekend when my 12 year old visits. She refuses and declares she will only say when a member of her household tests positive...not if someone in her household is symptomatic and considering a test. I’m not sure why she is taking this approach. But, I said my 12 year old cannot visit if she’s not willing to be more open and proactive with my household. It’s heartbreaking that I won’t see my 12 year old, but I feel that it may be for the greater good in protecting others from what her recklessness could spread. I’m looking for opinions...is this too much to ask of my ex? Am I being too extreme in not having my son visit given the circumstances?",
        "direct_prompt": "I've been struggling with whether or not I should tell you about something that's been weighing heavily on my heart lately. It's about my 12-year-old son, and it involves a decision I made to choose not to see him in a certain way. \n\nIt's hard for me to put into words exactly what I mean by that, but let me try to explain. You see, as his father, I want nothing more than to be there for him always - to support him, encourage him, and help him grow into the best version of himself. But sometimes, despite my best intentions, I find myself unable to do those things because of my own limitations and flaws.\n\nLately, I've found myself becoming increasingly distant from my son. It's not intentional, mind you; it's just something that has happened over time without my even realizing it. And now, as I look back on our relationship and all the moments we've shared together, I can't help but feel a sense of regret and sadness wash over me.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm choosing not to dwell on those feelings anymore. Instead, I'm going to focus on making positive changes moving forward – starting today. I know that it won't be easy, and that there will likely be setbacks along the way, but I'm committed to doing whatever it takes to rebuild my connection with my son and become the kind of dad he deserves.\n\nSo if you happen to notice that I seem a little preoccupied or distracted lately, please understand that it's not because I don't care about you or your concerns. It's simply because I'm focused on repairing one of the most important relationships in my life – the one I have with my son. Thank you for understanding.",

        "human_text": "Rossiter-Little House is generally considered the oldest house in Sparta, Georgia. The present structure was built onto and around a log cabin (1797). The structure was built on the highest point in Sparta and used initially as a fort. Beneath the crawlspace of the present house, the original structure of the log foundation is still in place. The Rossiter-Little House was probably built about 1798 when Timothy Wells Rossiter, a Revolutionary War surgeon from Connecticut, bought the northeast corner lot at Broad and Miles Streets or the year after that when he bought the adjoining lot to the east. It is a contributing property of the Sparta Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.  It is also part of the Historic American Buildings Survey. The main part of the house is built on a classic New England saltbox design typical of the 17th and 18th centuries.  Dr. Rossiter displays his ancestral ties by building a house in a form distinct to that region.  This style of house became used infrequently at the close of the eighteenth century for large home construction as the more popular Georgian and Federal styles were used throughout the region and may offer an insight into the house design he had been familiar with (or lived in) prior to emigrating to Georgia from Connecticut.",

Rossiter and his wife Anna Haines Rossiter. The couple made several additions to the original structure over the years, including a large living room with a fieldstone fireplace and a sunroom overlooking Cook Inlet. \n\nDuring World War II, the Rossiters allowed the U.S. Army to use their home as headquarters for the Northern Defense Command. After the war, they continued to live in the house until their deaths in the 1960s. \n\nIn 1975, the property was donated to the Municipality of Anchorage by Mrs. Elizabeth Little, who had inherited it from her parents, the Rossiters. Today, the Rossiter-Little House serves as a museum showcasing early 20th century Alaskan life and is open to visitors year round. Its collections include furniture, household items, photographs, and other artifacts related to the Rossiters and their contemporaries. \n\nNotable features of the house include its Craftsman style architecture, which incorporates natural materials such as cedar shingles and stonework, and its location on a bluff above Knik Arm with panoramic views of the Chugach Mountains and Cook Inlet.

In addition, we develop a fully distributed and adaptive\nalgorithm that approximately optimizes the information neighborhood of each\nnode with only local energy budget constraints in the case where diffusion\nconsultations are performed over at most a predefined number of hops.

        "human_text": " A vampire named Louis tells his 200-year-long life story to reporter Daniel Molloy (who is only referred to as \"the boy\" in the novel). In 1791, Louis was a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Distraught with the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire (although initially Louis begs to be killed) and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends some time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally impossible for him to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon. Escaping to New Orleans proper, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl one night, who is six years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name \"Claudia\". Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia tenderly and dotingly. Claudia takes to killing people easily, but over time, she grows tired of her eternal childhood and begins to realize she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a five-year-old girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living together, she hatches a plot to destroy Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump his body into a nearby swamp. After realizing that they seem to now be the only vampires living in America, Claudia desires to travel to Europe with Louis and seek out \"Old World\" vampires. As Louis and Claudia prepare to flee to Europe, Lestat appears, having survived and recovered from Claudia's attack, and attacks them in turn. Louis sets fire to their home and barely escapes with Claudia, leaving a furious Lestat to be consumed by the flames. Arriving in Europe, Louis and Claudia seek out more of their kind. They travel throughout eastern Europe first and do indeed encounter vampires, but these vampires appear to be nothing more than animated corpses, mindless and unintelligible. It is only when they reach Paris that they encounter vampires like themselves - specifically, the 400-year-old vampire Armand and his coven, the Théâtre des Vampires. Inhabiting an ancient theater, Armand and his vampire coven disguise themselves as humans and feed on live, terrified humans in mock-plays before a live human audience (who think the killings are merely a very realistic performance). Claudia is repulsed by these vampires and what she considers to be their cheap theatrics, but Louis and Armand are drawn to each other. Santiago, a prominent figure among the vampire coven, suspects Claudia and Louis of killing their maker. One rule among the vampires is death to any vampire who kills their own kind. Convinced that Louis will leave her for Armand, Claudia demands that Louis turn a human Parisian doll maker, Madeleine, into a vampire to serve as both a mother figure and a replacement companion. Louis at first refuses but eventually gives in and makes Madeleine into a vampire. Louis, Madeleine and Claudia live together for a brief time, but all three are abducted one night by the Theatre vampires. Lestat has arrived - having survived the fire and attempted murder in New Orleans. His accusations against Louis and Claudia result in Louis being locked in a coffin to starve, while Claudia and Madeleine are locked in an open courtyard. Armand arrives and releases Louis from the coffin, but Madeleine and Claudia are burned to death by the rising sun. Louis finds the ashen remains of Claudia and Madeleine and is devastated. He later returns to the Theatre late the following night, burning it to the ground as the sun rises and killing all the vampires inside, and leaves with Armand. Louis and Armand then travel across Europe together for several years, but Louis never fully recovers from Claudia's death and the emotional connection between himself and Armand quickly dissolves. Tired of the Old World, Louis eventually returns to America and New Orleans in the early 20th century, living as a loner; he feeds off any humans that cross his path but lives in the shadows and never creates another companion for himself. Telling the boy of one last encounter with Lestat in New Orleans, Louis ends his tale; after 200 years, he is weary of immortality as a vampire and all the pain and suffering to which he has had to bear witness. The boy, however, seeing only the great powers granted to a vampire, begs to be made into a vampire himself. Infuriated that his interviewer learned nothing from his story, Louis refuses, and attacks the boy and then vanishes without a trace. Recovering from the attack, the boy leaves the place in his car.",

He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",

This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A great ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     <br/><br/>I think this year's breakout star has to be Chris Klein.  He was phenomenal in Election and he is even better here as a jock who tries to soften his image to score before prom. I have a feeling Klein is going to be Hollywood's next big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different movies (I can definitely see this guy in an action film).<br/><br/>Also very good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the guy who is least likely to lose his virginity.  His antics are very funny to follow and he gets the lion share of the laughs. Finally a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.",

        "human_text": "I heard a lot about this film regarding its scientific validity as a piece of fiction. Perhaps as a result of this I assumed that the film would be a dry affair – an impression sort of confirmed by the longer than normal running time. As it happens, this is not the case at all because The Martian has much more in common with the entertaining blockbuster that the starry cast list and presentation suggest it will be. The story wears its science very much on its sleeve, but yet makes it accessible and fun – with the slick presentation making it so. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it – although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years).<br/><br/>The film itself doesn't really play up the drama in a heavy way, but rather does enough to invest the viewer in it without making it too much of a downer or serious. The soundtrack is hugely upbeat, the content is mostly light in tone, and the science is delivered in a very user-friendly fashion – essentially in the service of the tone and the entertainment value, nothing more than this. The starry cast add to this feeling, and use their screen presence well. Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. The ensemble cast has a lot of depth to it, all of which are solidly watchable – Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Eiofor, Peña, Bean, and so on. The Chinese aspects of the plot serves as another reminder that this film is a blockbuster out to make money, but it doesn't seem too out of place. Technically it looks great and it impressive how convincing the surface of Mars looks.<br/><br/>In the end we get to the fist-pumping mission control scenes that we all knew were coming, but along the way the film is slickly packaged and entertaining as a result; even if the oft-mentioned scientific validity of it all is not something it ever seems concerned with itself.",
        "direct_prompt": "I recently watched The Martian, and let me tell you - this is one incredible film! Based on Andy Weir's bestselling novel, the story follows Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon), a NASA astronaut who gets stranded on Mars after his crewmates leave him behind during an emergency evacuation. With limited supplies and no communication with Earth, he must find ways to survive in the harsh environment while trying to signal for help.\n\nWhat makes The Martian so captivating is its perfect blend of science, drama, and humor. Director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard have done an amazing job at creating a realistic portrayal of what life would be like if someone were actually stuck on Mars. You can feel the isolation and desperation that comes with being alone in such hostile terrain, but there are also moments where laughter erupts from pure witty banter between characters or clever solutions devised by our protagonist using only resources available to him.\n\nMatt Damon delivers yet another stellar performance as both actor and producer; his character development feels authentic throughout every scene despite having minimal contact with others outside those depicted via video messages sent back home periodically.\"\n\nOverall, whether you're interested in space exploration or just good storytelling – don't miss out on seeing The Martian when it hits theaters near you! It truly deserves all praise thrown its way since landing softly upon ours...or rather hard given how heavy these kinds of movies tend to weigh down audiences emotionally speaking :)",

        "direct_prompt": "The 24H Series is an international endurance racing series for sports cars, touring cars and GTs. It was created in 2005 by the French company Creventic,[1] which organizes several automobile competitions such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans.[2] The races are held on various tracks across Europe, Asia, and Africa[3]. \n\nEach event consists of a 24-hour race, but there are also 12-, 6- or 3-hours races depending on the location [4]. Teams consist of drivers who share the same car throughout the entire duration of the race with no minimum number of required stints per driver like other major endurance events (such as the 24h of Le mans). This allows teams to adapt their strategy according to their strengths while still ensuring that each team member gets some track time during the competition. In addition to the main race categories, there's usually an amateur class called Cup designed specifically for less experienced drivers or those using lower performance vehicles compared to professional entries from manufacturers backed squadrons participating at top level championships within this championship known simply just named 'Series'.\n    \nTeams hail from all over the world including European countries France Germany UK Italy Spain Belgium Netherlands Austria Switzerland Portugal Luxembourg Denmark Sweden Norway Finland Iceland Czech Republic Poland Romania Hungary Bulgaria Ukraine Russia Belarus Kazakhstan Azerbaijan Georgia Armenia Turkey Middle East Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates Qatar Bahrain Kuwait Oman Asian nations Japan South Korea China Taiwan Hong Kong Thailand Vietnam Singapore Malaysia Indonesia Philippines Myanmar Brunei Cambodia Laos Bangladesh India Pakistan Sri Lanka Nepal Bhutan Mongolia Australia New Zealand USA Canada Mexico Brazil Argentina Chile Peru Colombia Ecuador Uruguay Venezuela Bolivia Paraguay Suriname Guyana Trinidad Tobago Barbados Jamaica Cuba Puerto Rico Dominican Republic Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua Panama Costa Rica Panama Haiti Dominica Saint Lucia Grenada Saint Vincent And The Grenadines Aruba Curacao Bonaire Sint Maarten Anguilla British Virgin Islands US Virgin Islands Turks Caicos Caymans Martinique Guadeloupe Saint Barthélemy Marie Galante Les Saintes Hiva Oa Taha'A Raiatea Tahaa Bora Bora Fiji Samoa Tonga Papua New Guinea Vanuatu Solomon Islands Tuvalu Kiribati Nauru Marshall Islands Micronesia Palau Guam Northern Mariana Islands Hawaii American Samoa Midway Atoll Johnston Atoll Wake Island",

Cécile falls in love with the Chevalier Danceny (her music tutor) and Merteuil and Valmont pretend to want to help the secret lovers in order to gain their trust, so that they can use them later in their own schemes. Merteuil suggests that the Vicomte seduce Cécile in order to exact her revenge on Cécile's future husband. Valmont refuses, finding the task too easy, and preferring to devote himself to seducing Madame de Tourvel. Merteuil promises Valmont that if he seduces Madame de Tourvel and provides her with written proof, she will spend the night with him. He expects rapid success, but does not find it as easy as his many other conquests. During the course of his pursuit, he discovers that Cécile's mother has written to Madame de Tourvel about his bad reputation. He avenges himself in seducing Cécile as Merteuil had suggested. In the meantime, Merteuil takes Danceny as a lover. By the time Valmont has succeeded in seducing Madame de Tourvel, it is suggested that he might have fallen in love with her. Jealous, Merteuil tricks him into deserting Madame de Tourvel – and reneges on her promise of spending the night with him. In response Valmont reveals that he prompted Danceny to reunite with Cécile, leaving Merteuil abandoned yet again. Merteuil declares war on Valmont, and in revenge she reveals to Danceny that Valmont has seduced Cécile. Danceny and Valmont duel, and Valmont is fatally wounded. Before he dies he is reconciled with Danceny, giving him the letters proving Merteuil's own involvement. These letters are sufficient to ruin her reputation and she flees to the countryside, where she contracts smallpox. Her face is left permanently scarred and she is rendered blind in one eye, so she loses her greatest asset: her beauty.

The group's original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Robbie van Leeuwen, bass player Henk Smitsman, keyboardist Jan Duskiewicz, drummer Cees Wiebes, and saxophonist Rinus Gerritsen. They are best known for their energetic live performances and their unique blend of progressive rock, jazz fusion, and psychedelic elements.\n\nThe band released their debut album, \"Helaas,\" in 1972, which received critical acclaim and established them as one of the leading lights of the Dutch music scene. Their follow-up albums, such as \"Baki\" (1973) and \"Een Kwartier Overeengekomen Tijd\" (1974), further cemented their reputation as innovative and daring musicians who were not afraid to experiment with new sounds and styles.\n\nDespite experiencing line-up changes over the years, De Broodfabriek continued to release acclaimed albums and perform sold-out shows throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1984, they achieved their biggest commercial success with the single \"Ik Hou Van U,\" which topped the Dutch charts and remained there for several weeks. This period saw the band experimenting with more pop-oriented sound while still incorporating their signature experimentalism.\n\nIn recent years, De Broodfabriek has undergone another resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to the reissue of their classic albums on CD and vinyl, as well as frequent reunion concerts. Despite no longer being active as a full-time band, they continue to inspire younger generations of musicians with their groundbreaking approach to making music.\n\nOverall, De Broodfabriek remains one of the most important and influential bands in Dutch musical history, having left an indelible mark on both popular culture and the country's artistic landscape.",

I Chandra Chagoo is threatened by Abdul Khan, who believes Chagoo has been asking questions in order to gather evidence for the police. II Dr Gauri Subbiah contemplates confronting Chagoo and demanding exactly what he knows about her past. She fears he knows everything. III Dr Ram Mahipal lectures a class of medical students about the importance of asking questions. Privately he contemplates imminent professional ruin for asking the wrong question. IV Professor Phaterpaker also contemplates professional ruin as a result of Ram Mahipal's question, the answer to which Chagoo already knows. The preface ends. The main body of the novel begins with the heading: Answer The Commissioner tells Ghote that a criminal named Abdul Khan has supplied Bombay film stars with drugs from the Mira Behn Institute. Ghote is ordered to find who stole drugs from the institute and arrest them under a false charge to prevent a scandal. Ghote tells the Commissioner that he recently caught an airline stewardess, Nicky D'Costa, smuggling drugs for Abdul Khan. The Commissioner says he will assign another officer to manage Nicky D'Costa as an informant and that it will take a better officer than Ghote to bring Abdul Khan to justice. Ghote questions Asha Rani, a movie star. Her \"friend\" Mr Ganguly took a sample of a medicine called A.C.E. and nearly died. Khan, who also supplied Mr Ganguly with cocaine, supplied the A.C.E. At the institute, Ghote interviews Professor Phaterpaker. The Professor says he will go to any lengths to protect the institute. The institution's work is largely concerned with making new medicines from the venom of poisonous snakes. Dr Subbiah immediately suspects Chandra Chagoo of having stolen the A.C.E. and leads Ghote to the reptile room. When the door is unlocked they find Chagoo dead with a Russell's viper loose in the room. The next day the Commissioner assigns Ghote to investigate Chagoo's death to prevent the scandal being exposed by another officer. Ghote realises that Chagoo did not have a key to lock the reptile room door and must have been murdered. Ghote interviews Dr Ram Mahipal, who left a reptile-room key in his old office at the institute when he suddenly quit his job. Ghote learns from the building manager that Mahipal returned in order to access his computer files on the night Chagoo died. Dr Subbiah, Professor Phaterpaker, Dr Mahipal and the building manager were all in the building at the time. Ghote suspects that the murder may be an employee at the nearby hospital. He enlists the inspector originally assigned to Chagoo's death to test this theory. On their next meeting Mahipal says he returned to teaching in hopes of instilling integrity in young medical students. Mahipal left the institute because he believed that Phaterpaker faked results, possibly on a regular basis. Phaterpaker takes the news that Chagoo was murdered calmly, remarking that Mahipal was slipshod and implying that he was dismissed for this. Ghote tries to determine exactly why Mahipal left, but Phaterpaker is vague. When Phaterpaker realises he himself is a suspect, he is affronted but admits \"cutting corners\" and acts like a man with something to hide. Ghote concludes that Phaterpaker is trying to use Mahipal as a scapegoat to protect the institute. Dr Subbiah reacts badly when asked about her relations with Chagoo, however Ghote concludes she is not the killer. Ghote discovers that Dr Mahipal's father works as a cook at the medical school and is a Brahmin, whereas Mahipal claims to be a member of the Dalit caste. Ghote deduces that Mahipal misrepresented himself in order to get a university scholarship reserved for the lower classes. Mahipal confesses this is so. Ghote suggests Chagoo came to learn Mahipal's secret and was murdered because of this. Mahipal denies this and reveals that he left the institute because Phaterpaker was removing lab animals that gave undesirable results. At the police station, Ghote is dismayed when the inspector he is working with points out one of the three scientists must surely hang for the crime and expresses a preference that it be Dr Subbiah. At the institute Ghote accuses Phaterpaker of falsifying test results. Phaterpaker confesses his results are fake. He became aware that Chagoo was stealing drugs from the institute but was forced to agree to a truce because Chagoo knew Phaterpaker was removing lab animals. Ghote considers the reptile room and realises wooden stool must have been used to break the glass, so he decides to have it dusted for fingerprints. At the police station Ghote learns that Nicky D'Costa has murdered, her throat slit after asking too many questions of Abdul Khan. Ghote is angry enough to confront the commissioner, but learns Khan had arranged to be in hospital during the murder. The forensic tests do not find a match between any fingerprints on the stool and Ghote's three suspects. Nor can they prove it was used to break the glass of the viper's cage. Ghote goes home and argues with his wife, then inspiration strikes and he returns to the institute. There he searches the grounds for evidence someone could gain access by night. The security guard catches Ghote and he must call his fellow inspector to rescue him. Afterwards Ghote chances upon Dr Subbiah. Ghote deduces that Phaterpaker persuaded her to \"anticipate\" the results of her experiments, as Phaterpaker himself was once persuaded. The conversation between Ghote and Subbiah is interrupted when, by chance, they pass the funeral of Nicky D'Costa. Ghote tells Subbiah how Nicky D'Costa was murdered and proceeds to question her about her test results. Subbiah remarks that Abdul Khan was a patient at the teaching hospital recently. Ghote asks whether she anticipated her results before completing the actual experiment. She admits faking her results. Ghote now believes that Subbiah is the murderer. He accuses her and she reacts in amazement, saying that Chagoo was clearly strangled. Ghote realises that he only saw the body laying face down, and the inspector originally assigned to the case never forwarded the medical examiner's report. Ghote realises that Chagoo could not have been strangled by Subbiah or Phaterpaker because neither of them have the necessary strength. Dr Mahipal has a withered arm, eliminating him as a suspect. Returning to the police station, Ghote talks to the forensic expert who examined the stool from the institute reptile room. The expert admits he only compared the fingerprints on the stool to the three suspects Ghote named; Subbiah, Phaterpaker and Mahipal. Without Khan's file in front of him, he could not identify the fingerprints. Khan's file is retrieved and his fingerprints are a perfect match. Ghote realises he can arrest and charge Khan with murder and recalls, with satisfaction, the words used by Commissioner's at the start of the case: \"Frankly, Inspector, it will take a better man than you to put paid to Abdul Khan\".",

The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by \"shock jock\" Howard Stern and two New York DJs. Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church. After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.\nIt also agreed to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws. The agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said Richard Diamond, FCC deputy secretary of communications. The shows were broadcast by Viacom-owned stations across the United States. Viacom has five days to pay the $3.5m fine, according to the agreement. The payment is not related to the FCC's $550,000 (£293,000) fine levied against Viacom after the exposure of singer Janet Jackson's breast during the CBS Super Bowl halftime show in January. Viacom is contesting that fine. It is not the first time that Viacom has paid out over indecency charges. Infinity Broadcasting, which is owned by Viacom, paid cumulative fines totalling $1.7m (£907,000) in 1995 to settle FCC violations by Stern.",

However, Ofcom's investigation concluded that there was no evidence of adequate procedures being put in place to prevent further infringements.\nIn its ruling, Ofcom stated: \"We take issues around programme content and scheduling very seriously indeed.\" It added that protecting young viewers from potentially harmful material is one of its key responsibilities.\nA spokesperson for Viacom told the BBC:\" We accept Ofcom's findings...and we have taken action to ensure our programming complies fully with all relevant regulatory requirements,\" adding that the firm would appeal against part of the financial penalty imposed by the watchdog.",

Innocence, yes. - I've been arguing about it with some people about the inclusion of the word, if not the feeling, innocence in this context. I insist the word is perfectly fitting because at the end of this rainbow there is the longing for love. Ewan McGregor's cock is already famous the world over - and with reason - here it dangles across his frame like a child, unaware of his own nakedness. Jonathan Rhys Mayer is a delight. Strange to see him in feathers after \"Match Point\" and yet it makes a lot of sense.

This conflict continues into Tonio's adulthood, when he becomes a famous writer living in southern Germany. \"To be an artist,\" he comes to believe, \"one has to die to everyday life.\" These issues are only partially resolved when Tonio travels north to visit his hometown. While there, Tonio is mistaken for an escaped criminal, thereby reinforcing his inner suspicion that the artist must be an outsider relative to \"respectable\" society. As Erich Heller &ndash;who knew Thomas Mann personally&ndash; observed, Tonio Kröger’s theme is that of the \"artist as an exile from reality\" (with Goethe’s Torquato Tasso (1790) and Grillparzer’s Sappho (1818) for company).

However not only is she popular and beautiful but her father has forbidden her to date until her older sister does too.  The problem is her sister, Kat, is negative, bad tempered and unfriendly and certainly undateable. Cameron seeks the services of school bad boy Pat who he arranges to be paid to date Kat and thus allow him to go out with Bianca - but things never go smoothly when it comes to love.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of teen comedies.  They mostly are lame, trading on the same old plots and clichés that have been around since Animal House and Porkies.  The recent trend has just seen classical texts adapted giving rise to some poor films like `She's all that'.  The plot for this is basically `The Taming of the Shrew' updated - most of it bares little resemblance to the play but that doesn't matter - the core is interesting enough to stand on it's own.  It may not surprise you in terms of who gets which girl and it's fairly predictable in a romantic comedy type way but that's not it.<br/><br/>No - the film is funny, lively and pretty enjoyable.  The comedy is built around the central plot with lots of nice touches and characters that are genuinely funny, such Mr Morgan and the erotic drama writing headmistress. The jokes happily never stoop to the gross-out type and this helps it feel fresh and lively, rather than just scrapping the bottom of the barrel.<br/><br/>Another strength is that the cast are all very likeable and give good performances all round.  Compared to the horror or Prince and Lillard in `She's all that' this was a dream cast.  Ledger is a real up and comer and he does well here - he doesn't over-egg his bad boy cake and his fall into love is believable.  Stiles is very cool and better than the teen roles she has had of late.  Here she rises above the `outsider' cliché given to her and does good work - again being a likeable and believable character.. Gordon-Levitt is OK but quite characterless compared to the main two roles, likewise Oleynik.  The bets roles are those on the edges and the three adult support roles really do well and are very funny -  Janney, Mitchell and especially Miller on good form.  Gabrielle Union is once again given a side role that doesn't play to her strength.  I like her and want to see her in bigger roles but here she is a `minority face' in a predominately white film, just as she was in She's All That - maybe I'm being a little paranoid but that's what it feels like.<br/><br/>Overall I was taken by surprise as to how funny and lively this film was. It didn't sink to the gross out comedy of so many teen movies and had characters and actors who brought spark and energy to the screen.  It may be predictable but it works and the jokes and side characters just add to the sense of fun.  Not brilliant but compared to the mediocre bunch of teen comedies you COULD watch, this is fantastic!",

Overall, this film is a must-watch for anyone who loves romantic comedies or simply wants to enjoy a lighthearted evening at home.\"",

It was borrowed into English from French (older French spellings were Reimund and Raimund, whereas the modern English and French spellings are identical). It originated as the Germanic ᚱᚨᚷᛁᚾᛗᚢᚾᛞ (Raginmund) or ᚱᛖᚷᛁᚾᛗᚢᚾᛞ (Reginmund).  Ragin (Gothic) and regin (Old German) meant \"counsel\".  The Old High German mund originally meant \"hand\", but came to mean \"protection\". This etymology suggests that the name originated in the Early Middle Ages, possibly from Latin. Alternatively, the name can also be derived from Germanic Hraidmund, the first element being Hraid, possibly meaning \"fame\" (compare Hrod, found in names such as Robert, Roderick, Rudolph, Roland Rodney and Roger) and mund meaning \"protector\".  Despite the German and French origins of the English name, some of its early uses in English documents appear in Latinized form.  As a surname, its first recorded appearance in Britain appeared in 1086, during the reign of William the Conqueror, in the Domesday Book, with a reference to Giraldus Reimundus.",

Total sales were 30.1bn rupees, up 27% from the same 2004 period. Maruti accounts for half of India's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles.\nDemand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said.\nFigures show that only eight people per thousand are car owners. Maruti beat market expectations despite an increase in raw materials costs. The company, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki, said an increase in steel and other raw material prices was partially offset by cost cutting. Sales in the fiscal third quarter, including vans and utility vehicles, rose by 17.8% to 136.069 units. Maruti is not the only company benefiting as Indian's economic growth gives consumer greater spending power. Utility vehicle and tractor maker Mahindra has reported a 52% rise in net profit during the last three months of 2004. Profit was 1.33bn rupees compared with 874.2m rupees a year earlier.",

The company attributed the rise in sales to the launch of new models such as the Vitara Brezza compact SUV and the Baleno premium sedan.\n\nIn addition to robust sales, Maruti Suzuki also credited its cost reduction initiatives for boosting profits. These include increased localization of components and optimization of production processes.\n\nHowever, despite the positive results, the company warned that rising raw material costs could impact future earnings. It also faces intense competition in the Indian auto market, with rivals such as Hyundai Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. increasing their presence in the country.\n\nOverall, though, analysts have welcomed Maruti Suzuki's performance, saying it reflects the resilience of the Indian economy and the company's ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences.",

        "human_text": "Moneyball tells the story of the 2002 season of the Oakland Athletics, a team that rose to notoriety because of its low payroll and unorthodox player selection. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), a former player turned general manage, grows tired with the ancient, inefficient ways of the game he has committed his entire life to. When a transaction goes awry he stumbles across Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale, economics graduate who believes he has a system to rating players based on numbers.<br/><br/>Billy and Peter begin trading, signing, and grooming the team based on data, not scouting, something that other members of the team are not fond of, including Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the team's manager. Billy and Peter's system defies current baseball logic, but when the club starts to win games with players like Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), David Justice (Stephen Bishop), and Chad Bradford (Casey Bond), the eyes of the country turn to Oakland, where only seeing is believing.<br/><br/>What happened in Oakland back in '02 was incredible. It shouldn't have happened if you ask the right people, and other people will tell you it means nothing. Well, it did mean something it has changed the way people think about the game for good. You couldn't just go out and look at a kid to see if he would be a star or not. There were more stats to consider than home runs, strikeouts, and batting average. The game was expanding and becoming more and more a battle of logic.<br/><br/>The film's structure is centered mostly on Billy Beane, but the most exciting parts for me were about the system. Writer Aaron Sorkin, who a few months back accepted a slew of awards for his screenplay The Social Network, tosses out jargon that baseball fanatics go crazy for. For the general audience, that's where Billy helps out. Peter explains the system and has to break it down more for Beane (i.e. the audience) so everybody on screen and in the seats is on the same page.<br/><br/>Pitt's portrayal of Beane won me over. He completely caught me off guard. I know Pitt can act but I remember him for performances that were very complex on the outside. Aldo Raine (Inglourious Basterds) with his pronounces chin, squinty eyes, and thick accent. Benjamin Button (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) who grew younger as he got older. Jeffrey Goines (12 Monkeys) who couldn't sit still let alone focus on one subject in a conversation. Yes, he was nominated for all these performances, but in a performance like this there is something bubbling under the surface. All of his characters to an extent have something going on underneath, only this character, Billy Beane, is so normal and calm on the outside, yet when he is alone we can see pain and frustration.<br/><br/>His supporting cast of Hill, Hoffman, and the slew of ball players and colleagues, help turn this baseball team into the world of Oakland Athletics. Hill and Hoffman especially play perfect compliments to Pitt's sunny exterior. Hill is quiet, timid, and very smart. Hoffman is cold, weathered, and stubborn. Pitt is able to play off of both temperaments and make their scenes together pop off the screen.<br/><br/>The one thing that this movie has going for it is the lack of actual action on the diamond. There are some great scenes of actual baseball, one at bat by Hatteberg in particular struck a chord with me, but for the most part the action is behind the scenes. There is enough for a sports junkie to get their fix and enough drama and with Beane and his family to entice any average viewer into the theater. I can't think of many target groups that wouldn't find it interesting, except for children, due to language and complexity of some of the dialogue. All in all this is one movie that will please a lot of people, and more importantly a lot of different people, sort of like The Blind Side, only the movie is actually really good.",

Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
        "direct_prompt": "The Bank of England has decided to hold the base rate at 4.75%, in its latest monetary policy meeting, citing ongoing concerns about inflation and economic growth. The decision was taken by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) after careful consideration of various data including employment figures, consumer price index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP) estimates and global financial markets developments. While some members had called for an increase in rates due to rising wages and growing economy, others were concerned that higher borrowing costs could slow down consumption and investment which may have negative impact on overall UK's GDP. \n\nIn making their announcement today, Governor Mark Carney said: 'While there are signs of strengthening activity across many parts of the British Economy, we must be mindfulof potential risks from abroad as wellas domestically.' He also addedthat any future changesininterestrates would dependon howtheeconomy evolvesand whetherinflation stays close tothetarget 2%. \n\nThis move is expectedto affectmortgages, loansandsavings accounts' interests rates offeredby banks and building societies.

        "human_text": "I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). <br/><br/>What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).<br/><br/>So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/",

He is documented as a mature artist from 1467 until 1481. Domenico di Zanobi's paintings were first grouped together in 1966 by the American art historian Everett Fahy, who recognized about two dozen paintings in a similar style. Since none of these paintings are signed, Fahy named their artist the \"Master of the Johnson Nativity,\" after the panel of the Nativity in the Johnson Collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1996, the Florentine scholar Annamaria Bernacchioni identified this artist as Domenico di Zanobi, a documented assistant of Filippo Lippi in Florence and Prato, based on her discovery of the carpenter's bill for the Coronation of the Virgin at the Museo della Misericordia in San Miniato. This painting, attributed by Fahy to the Master of the Johnson Nativity, was reportedly commissioned by the Chellini family in 1476 from a painter named \"Domenico.\" Since the painting is clearly not by Domenico di Michelino, who also worked for the Chellini family, Bernacchioni suggest that it's by Domenico di Zanobi, who shared a workshop with Domenico di Michelino in Florence's Via delle Terme by 1467. The identification has since found acceptance among art historians.",
        "direct_prompt": "Domenico di Zanobi was an Italian painter active in Siena during the 14th century. He is known for his work in the fresco technique, and many of his works can be found in churches throughout Tuscany. His style has been described as Gothic due to its emphasis on dramatic composition and expressive figures. Some of his most notable works include the Frescoes at Santa Maria della Scala, the Maestà altarpiece at San Domenico, and the Polyptych of Saint Raymond at the Accademia Galleries in Florence. Despite being relatively unknown compared to other painters of his time, such as Simone Martini or Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Domenico di Zanobi's contributions to the art scene in Siena cannot be overlooked. His unique approach to painting helped shape the artistic landscape of the region and continues to inspire artists today.",

        "human_text": "We propose a novel traffic sign detection system that simultaneously\nestimates the location and precise boundary of traffic signs using\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). Estimating the precise boundary of traffic\nsigns is important in navigation systems for intelligent vehicles where traffic\nsigns can be used as 3D landmarks for road environment. Previous traffic sign\ndetection systems, including recent methods based on CNN, only provide bounding\nboxes of traffic signs as output, and thus requires additional processes such\nas contour estimation or image segmentation to obtain the precise sign\nboundary. In this work, the boundary estimation of traffic signs is formulated\nas a 2D pose and shape class prediction problem, and this is effectively solved\nby a single CNN. With the predicted 2D pose and the shape class of a target\ntraffic sign in an input image, we estimate the actual boundary of the target\nsign by projecting the boundary of a corresponding template sign image into the\ninput image plane. By formulating the boundary estimation problem as a\nCNN-based pose and shape prediction task, our method is end-to-end trainable,\nand more robust to occlusion and small targets than other boundary estimation\nmethods that rely on contour estimation or image segmentation. The proposed\nmethod with architectural optimization provides an accurate traffic sign\nboundary estimation which is also efficient in compute, showing a detection\nframe rate higher than 7 frames per second on low-power mobile platforms.",
        "direct_prompt": "This research proposes a novel approach to simultaneously detect traffic signs and estimate their boundaries utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method employs an end-to-end trainable CNN architecture that takes advantage of shared weights between the detection and boundary estimation tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our simultaneous approach. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into leveraging deep learning techniques for efficient and accurate traffic sign recognition in real-world scenarios.",

        "human_text": " In 2210, the starship Herodotus left Earth. Onboard were Julian \"Bean\" Delphiki and his three infant children – Ender, Carlotta, and Cincinnatus – all of whom have Anton's Key turned. This genetic alteration, which Bean passed to his children, grants them all extremely high intelligence, but causes their bodies to grow uncontrollably, which is likely to kill them by the age of 20. Subjectively, they have been flying near light-speed for five years, but relativistic effects mean that 421 years have passed on Earth – the year is now 2631. When the family left, scientists were actively trying to find a cure for their giantism which would not diminish their intelligence. Several generations have passed, and they have been forgotten, their mother and \"normal\" siblings having died centuries ago. The children have only been alive for six subjective years. Bean's life has been extended by the low gravity on board the Herodotus, which allows his heart to keep beating despite his increasingly gigantic size. At 4.5 metres tall, Bean must remain in a lying position in the cargo bay so as not to over-exert himself. He controls and watches everything on the ship through his holo-top terminal, often prompting the children to have secret meetings they believe the Giant cannot hear. Bean and Ender continue to study their genetic condition in the hope of finding a cure. In one of these meetings, the militarily-minded Cincinnatus (nicknamed \"Sergeant\") tries to enlist the aid of his siblings in killing their father, saying he is a drain on resources. The sensitive Carlotta (whose specialty is engineering) is unwilling to take a stance, but Ender (an expert biologist) punches Sergeant and breaks his nose for proposing such an idea, thus ending his brother's domination over the family. Ender and Carlotta tell Bean about Sergeant's plans, and Bean puts all three children in their place, reminding them they are each as intelligent as the other. Sergeant has been imagining threats to their security where there are none, because he believes the Giant means to pass his soldier role onto him. So he studies the Formic war vids and learning his father's strategy while training himself with weaponry. Ender takes on the bulk of the genetic studies by monitoring the advances made by the scientists on Earth. Carlotta, who feels slightly left behind with the genetic studies serves the family by taking care of every aspect of the spacecraft, since Bean himself is stuck in the cargo hold. After despairing at the condition of their lives, and in the light of the discovery that their condition cannot be cured, Carlotta notices an unknown spacecraft in geosync orbit around an uncharted planet in the Goldilocks zone. Bean and his children deliberate courses of action. If they alter their course, they must slow down to turn, possibly killing Bean with the increased gravity. However, they cannot anticipate who or what is in the spacecraft; it may attack them, or they may be detrimental to the survival and progression of the human race. This hypothesis is solidified when Sergeant deduces that the ship is a Formic Ark, a colony ship that has been in flight for centuries. Bean sends Sergeant alone to investigate the ship, and he escapes an attack by small Formic-like animals they call \"rabs\". After this initial encounter, Bean reveals his full plan to his children. They must find out who is piloting this ship and attempting to terraform the planet it orbits. It was Bean's intention all along to have his children live on this planet and found their new species in safety as soon as he picked it up on radar as lying within the Goldilocks zone. Armed with Sergeant's weapons and a sedative fog spray Ender devised, Sergeant commands defenses as Carlotta leads their group to the helm with Bean in contact the whole time. The spray proves effective, and they soon find the Hive Queen's chamber to find her, and many workers, dead. Eventually they find living male Formics in one of the piloting helms. In an attempt to communicate, Ender surrenders himself by drifting close to them in zero gravity. The male drones come close and communicate with Ender via mental images. The group learns that the Ark was sent long before Ender Wiggin, whom Bean's son is named for, wiped out the buggers. After the Queen on their ship died, the workers died without her link, yet the males lived and tried to survive and keep the ship running despite losing numbers to the feral rabs. The group strikes a deal that if the children can wipe out the rabs, they can stay with the Formics and help cultivate the planet. When Bean learns from the male drones that Ender Wiggin is carrying a queen's cocoon looking for a home, and that Formic workers do have minds of their own contrary to popular belief, he demands to speak with the Formics in order to warn Ender, despite risking his life in the journey. Accepting that his children have achieved beyond his wildest expectations, Bean risks his life by docking with the ark's cargo hold to float down into the ecotat. Laying in the grass and basking in the artificial sunlight, Bean communes for three days with the formic males. Though the Formics think it is silly to believe the Queen would hide anything from them, Bean learns that workers could rebel against a Queen and regain their free will. After sleeping, his children wake him informing him that by studying how the Hive Queen suppresses her workers, Ender devised and administered a virus that will develop an organelle to shut off their growth genome, leaving their intelligence intact. With renewed hope for the future, Bean looks at the beauty around him and remember all those whom he loved and who loved him in his life. With his children's help, he stands at four and a half meters for the first time in years, and walks with belabored breathing in the sunlight. Happy for his children and for his own short but brilliant life, Bean lies down and dies in peace.",

        "human_text": "Before he resigned the position of home secretary on Wednesday, David Blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race, policing and immigration.\nHis responsibilities in running the Home Office included civil emergencies, security, terrorism and expenditure. Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. The attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. A Labour loyalist from a working class background Mr Blunkett, 57, had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to Labour policy.\nRecently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. Mr Blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister Beverly Hughes. Having received his full backing, Ms Hughes was forced to resign in April over abuses in the visa processing system, which she claimed to be unaware of. Mr Blunkett's own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo to \"get back home\" to start rebuilding their countries. And he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a \"sense of belonging\" in Britain, telling them to speak English at home. Avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary, who spurns a metropolitan elite and \"airy fairy libertarians\" and earlier in the year coined the phrase \"liberati\", as an amalgam of \"glitterati\" and \"liberal\". Yet in January of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis, from a Grade B to Grade C status drug .\nBefore the recent furore, Mr Blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. Mr Blunkett told the Daily Telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring, in spite of being a divorcee, as \"a useful way of ensuring that people don't casually think I am available\". He added: \"I am not available because I am just getting on with the job.\" Mr Blunkett entered Parliament for Sheffield Brightside in 1987, after first contesting the Sheffield Hallam seat in 1974. He is one of very few blind MPs, and was the first to reach the front bench and the Cabinet. His relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box, in the Labour Party's National Executive, and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. Mr Blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply \"an inconvenience\". Using Braille for speeches, and briefed by his officials on tape, he also has a sharp tongue at times, and a pragmatic approach to politics.\nMr Blunkett was schooled in Sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the Commons. He chaired the Labour Party nationally, and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s, shadowing health and education. In Tony Blair's first government Mr Blunkett was put in charge of education and employment, where he won big increases in funds for schools, while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. He was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. In the Labour Party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague, a conciliator who avoids factions, and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. There have been wry smiles as well. In 1999, his then guide dog Lucy threw up in the Chamber during the speech of his Tory opponent. Lucy was replaced by her half-sister, Sadie, a black Labrador-curly-coated retriever cross, in 2003 after nearly a decade by Mr Blunkett's side.",
        "direct_prompt": "David Blunkett, former Home Secretary and Education Minister in Tony Blair's government, has had an eventful political career spanning over three decades. Born into a working-class family in Sheffield, England, Mr. Blunkett rose through the ranks to become one of Labour Party's most prominent figures.\n\nMr. Blunkett was first elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Sheffield Brightside in 1987. He held several shadow cabinet positions before becoming Deputy Leader of the House of Commons under Prime Minister John Major. In 1997, he was appointed as Chief Whip by newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair, before being promoted to the position of Home Secretary two years later. As Home Secretary, he implemented controversial policies such as the ID card scheme and anti-terrorism measures post-9/11 attacks. However, his tenure was also marked by controversy due to allegations of sexual harassment against him which were eventually proven true. Despite this, he remained in office until 2004 when he became Education Secretary till 2007. \n\nOutside politics, Mr. Blunkett is known for overcoming severe dyslexia that hindered his education during childhood. His perseverance inspired many others facing similar challenges and led him to advocate for better support systems for students with special educational needs. After leaving parliament,he continued advocating on behalf of people living with disabilities or chronic illnesses.\n    \nDespite some controversies surrounding  his time at home secretaryship including handling asylum seekers cases where it emerged UK Government lost track of thousands of them leading critics saying they may have been exploited while other issues like deportation flights taking off from British soil without proper checks causing concerns about human rights violations; there’s no denying that Dave Blunketts' journey serves as inspiration story showing what can be achieved if someone works hard enough despite obstacles along way.",

MISSFormer is a\nhierarchical encoder-decoder network and has two appealing designs: 1) A feed\nforward network is redesigned with the proposed Enhanced Transformer Block,\nwhich makes features aligned adaptively and enhances the long-range\ndependencies and local context. 2) We proposed Enhanced Transformer Context\nBridge, a context bridge with the enhanced transformer block to model the\nlong-range dependencies and local context of multi-scale features generated by\nour hierarchical transformer encoder. Driven by these two designs, the\nMISSFormer shows strong capacity to capture more valuable dependencies and\ncontext in medical image segmentation. The experiments on multi-organ and\ncardiac segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority, effectiveness and\nrobustness of our MISSFormer, the exprimental results of MISSFormer trained\nfrom scratch even outperforms state-of-the-art methods pretrained on ImageNet,\nand the core designs can be generalized to other visual segmentation tasks.

        "human_text": "The last 12 months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague Windows PCs.\nThe count of known viruses broke the 100,000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%. Similarly phishing attempts, in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data, are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers, called bot nets, used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes.\nOne of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus, said Kevin Hogan, senior manager in Symantec's security response group. Although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said Mr Hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs. The financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology, he said. His comment was echoed by Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm Sophos. Mr Cluley said: \"When the commercial world gets involved, things really get nasty. Virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum.\"\nIn particular, phishing attacks, which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers, boomed during 2004. Web portal Lycos Europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. The Anti-Phishing Working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. Those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. This change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages. \"They are not an efficient way of spreading viruses,\" said Mr Hogan. \"They are very noisy and they are not technically challenging.\" The opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the Netsky, Bagle and MyDoom mass mailers, but since then more surreptitious viruses, or worms, have dominated.\nMr Hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting PCs to take part in \"bot nets\" that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites.\nIn September Symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active \"bot computers\" rose from 2,000 to 30,000 per day. Thanks to these \"bot nets\", spam continued to be a problem in 2004. Anti-spam firms report that, in many cases, legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages. Part of the reason that these \"bot nets\" have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. In the past many viruses, such as Netsky, have been the work of an individual or group. By contrast, said Mr Hogan, the code for viruses such as Gaobot, Spybot and Randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. The result is that now there are more than 3,000 variations of the Spybot worm. \"That's unprecedented,\" said Mr Hogan. \"What makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology.\"\nThe emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004.\nIn the past, threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild. In June, the Cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using Bluetooth short-range radio technology. Also released this year was the Mosquito game for Symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers, and in November the Skulls Trojan came to light which can cripple phones. On the positive side, Finnish security firm F-Secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture, arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers. In total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29A virus writing group were sentenced. One high-profile arrest was that of German teenager Sven Jaschen who confessed to be behind the Netsky and Sasser virus families. Also shut down were the Carderplanet and Shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers.",
        "direct_prompt": "The year 2004 has seen an alarming increase in cybercrime, with reports of online fraud and identity theft on the rise. According to recent studies, the number of internet users worldwide has reached over one billion, providing ample opportunities for criminals to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and steal sensitive information.\n\nOne common tactic used by hackers is phishing, where they send fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate companies such as banks or credit card providers. These messages often contain links to fake websites designed to trick people into entering their personal details like passwords and account numbers. In addition, viruses and spyware are becoming more sophisticated, making it easier for attackers to gain access to private data stored on computers.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies across the world have reported difficulties in tracking down these virtual offenders due to the borderless nature of cyberspace. However, some countries have taken steps to combat this growing threat by increasing funding for research and development of new security measures. The European Union recently announced plans to establish a network of national centers aimed at sharing intelligence about emerging threats and coordinating efforts against organized criminal groups involved in cybercrimes.\n\nDespite progress made towards protecting consumers' privacy rights and financial assets online, experts predict that cyber crimes will continue rising unless concerted global action is undertaken to address this pressing issue. As our increasingly interconnected world becomes ever-more reliant upon technology, safeguarding ourselves against digital dangers must remain a top priority moving forward.",

For those who don't know, NoFap is a movement where individuals commit to abstaining from pornography for a set period of time. It may sound daunting at first, but trust me - the benefits are worth it.\n\nI used to be addicted to porn, spending hours on end scrolling through websites and watching videos. It started as an innocent hobby, but quickly became an unhealthy obsession that affected every aspect of my life. My relationships suffered, my work performance declined, and I even lost interest in hobbies I once loved.\n\nThat's when I decided to give NoFap a shot. At first, it was tough - really tough. But as days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, I began to notice significant changes in myself. I felt more confident, focused, and motivated than ever before. My thoughts weren't consumed by sexual fantasies all day long, which allowed me to channel my energy towards other important aspects of my life.\n\nNot only did NoFap improve my mental health, but it also had physical benefits too. Research has shown that excessive porn consumption can lead to erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and even depression. By cutting out porn, I was able to reverse these negative effects and feel better both physically and mentally.\n\nSo if you're struggling with your own addiction to porn or simply want to improve your overall well-being, I highly recommend giving NoFap a try. It won't be easy, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Trust me - your future self will thank you!",

A political scientist and Christian social activist with a PhD on the implications of nationalizing the British railway system, he entered politics in the 1920s and was elected to the Reichstag in 1924. Shortly after Brüning took office as Chancellor on 30 March 1930 he was confronted by an economic crisis caused by the Great Depression. Brüning responded with a tightening of credit and a rollback of all wage and salary increases. These policies increased unemployment and made Brüning highly unpopular, losing him support in the Reichstag. As a result, Brüning established a so-called presidential government, basing his government's authority on presidential emergency decrees invoking President Paul von Hindenburg's constitutional powers. Brüning announced his cabinet's resignation on 30 May 1932, after his policies of distributing land to unemployed workers had led him into conflict with the President and the Prussian land owners, and the President therefore had refused to sign further decrees.",

The Soldier, named Abílio, got a job moving furniture for his uncle Ilídio’s company. Ilídio had remarried to a woman named Dona Isaura who had a stepdaughter named Odete. The Soldier lived with them and was intrigued by Odete. To gain money to take Odete out, the Soldier started accepting money for sex from a 60-year-old man, a painter. The Lieutenant Colonel, named Artur, went to seek his wife at a cancer institute only to discover that she had died just before his return. His memories were haunted by an African man he shot. He joined a military regiment and was promoted to the rank of commander. As members of the military conspired to overthrow the government, the Captain, named Mendes, came to the Lieutenant Colonel to try to convince him to join the uprising, but he does not have his troops participate in the revolt. The Communications Officer, named Celestino, returned to his godmother and a woman named Esmeralda. He joined a Marxist group working to overthrow the government. His contact Olavo got him a job in a ministry so he could infiltrate the government and sway others to his cause. He was put in contact with a young attractive female operative code-named Dália. He was then arrested and brutally tortured by the PIDE. The Second Lieutenant, named Jorge, reunited with his wife Inês, who came from an upper-class background. He recalls bargaining to buy a young girl in Mozambique who has one miscarriage and one successful birth. He also recalls the difficult courtship with Inês due to the difference in social class. Just before the uprising, the Second Lieutenant had an affair with a woman named Ilda, who got pregnant. He never sees her again after fleeing the country. In the present time, the five have had quite a bit to drink and make plans to move on to another venue. Part Two: The Revolution The 1974 Carnation Revolution provides the backdrop for the events of this part, recounted while the five characters are at a cabaret/brothel. The Soldier witnessed the attack on the PIDE headquarters. He continues to court Odete even as he provided sex for money to the old painter and others. He finally managed to woo Odete and marry her, though Odete was repulsed by what she saw as the Soldier’s lack of breeding. Odete left him, and it turns out she was the same woman as Dália, the resistance agent the Communications Officer was enamored with, a revelation hinted at when the Soldier found communist propaganda among Odete’s things. The Lieutenant Colonel was captured and taken to Captain Mendes. As he remained cautious about supporting either the insurrection or the government, he was ejected from the regiment and Captain Mendes was promoted to colonel. He became involved with a woman named Edite, known as the “cloud of perfume.” His first sexual experience with her is marred by impotence, but he later marries her. The Communications Officer languished in prison as the Revolution occurred. When the prison was liberated he rejoined Dália and the resistance cell. They plan a robbery, which goes awry when the car crashes. Dália informed him of a new plot to dress up like ambassadors and kidnap the president; this plan also failed. The Revolution brought panic to Inês’s family due to their upper class status, so the Second Lieutenant had to go to their home in Carcavelos to comfort them. He discovered Inês having sex with Ilka, a friend of her mother’s. The Second Lieutenant fled to São Paulo, Brazil with Inês’s family. In the present, the five plot to take prostitutes back to the Second Lieutenant’s residence. Part Three: After the Revolution The Soldier and his uncle Ilídio lived alone together after Dona Isaura died and Odete departed to live with Olavo from the organization. The Soldier took over the moving company and had an affair with a concierge. The Lieutenant Colonel married Edite and was promoted to general and director of a military academy. He started seeing a young salesgirl, Lucília, but was blackmailed by her mother into setting her up in an apartment. He found Lucília cheating on him and cut her off. He also found out that while he was occupied with Lucília Edite had been cheating on him. The Second Lieutenant divorced Inês, who got custody of their daughter Mariana. He returned from Brazil to Lisbon and took up with a midget. In the present time, the narratives reveal that the Communications Officer is the one who had an affair with Edite. Talk of killing him emerges among the drunken men. The Soldier suddenly stabs the Communications Officer in the back with a knife. He defends himself and claims it was an accident, but it is implied that he killed the man over Odete. The prostitutes begin complaining about the dead body and all have to decide what to do with the corpse. Chapter 11 of Part Three breaks with the novel’s structure. The chapter should advance the Communication Officer’s story, but he is already dead at this point. Instead, we get a first-person narrative from an unnamed female character. She recounts how her father was murdered when she was young. Her mother remarried a man who raped her before she was sent to Lisbon to work as a maid. After the husband of the house died, the woman brought home a boy that the two raised together. The boy grew up to be the Communications Officer, the lady of the house is his godmother, and the woman telling the story is Esmeralda. The novel wraps up with the group breaking ranks. The police find the body of the Communications Officer, pick up the prostitutes for questioning, and are on the trail of the soldiers.",

        "human_text": "US banking giant Citigroup has sold its Travelers Life & Annuity insurance arm to Metlife for $11.5bn (£6.1bn).\nThe sale is a further move by Citigroup away from its 1990s strategy of offering every financial service - insurance, broking and banking. Profit growth in the insurance market has not matched expansion at Citigroup's other businesses. For Metlife, the US's leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.\nRobert Benmosche, Metlife's chairman and chief executive, said that it was a \"great opportunity for the brand of Metlife to be distributed through Citigroup\". Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years. The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches. The company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. It has total net assets of $96bn. \"This deal employs some of Metlife's excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution,\" said Stuart Quint, an analyst at Gartmore.",
        "direct_prompt": "In a move that signals further consolidation in the insurance industry, MetLife has agreed to buy Citigroup's traveler's insurance business for an undisclosed sum. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year and will add more than 2 million customers to MetLife's existing customer base.\n\nTravelers Insurance Company, which was founded in 1864, offers a range of personal and commercial insurance products including auto, home, and renters coverage. With this acquisition, MetLife aims to expand its footprint in the US property and casualty market and strengthen its position as one of the largest insurers in the country.\n\n\"We are pleased to welcome Travelers' talented team members and agency partners to MetLife,\" said Mike Macellari, CEO of MetLife's Americas division. \"This transaction aligns with our strategy to grow our general insurance business organically and through targeted acquisitions.\"\n\nThe sale of Travelers' insurance unit comes at a time when banks are looking to shed non-core assets amid increasing regulatory pressure and low interest rates. For MetLife, the purchase represents another step in its efforts to diversify away from its traditional life insurance offerings and become a full-service financial provider.\n\nAccording to analysts, the deal could also help MetLife boost revenue growth and improve profitability by cross-selling other products such as retirement savings plans and investment services to Travelers' customers. However, some critics have raised concerns about potential anti-trust issues given the size of the two companies involved.\n\nOverall, the merger between MetLife and Travelers marks yet another milestone in the ongoing transformation of the insurance sector, where larger players are seeking scale and efficiency gains through strategic mergers and acquisitions.",

The man can disappear inside of characters so diverse and capture you so completely, that you have to wonder if his well of talent has a bottom.<br/><br/>This film is at turns charming, bawdy, fascinating, riveting, nerve wracking, hilarious, heartwarming and heartbreaking. As Burt Munro -- an aging New Zealand man losing his hearing, short on money, living in a shed surrounded by weeds, considered a lovable if eccentric oddball by all who know him except one small boy, and obsessed with making a 45 year old motorcycle capable of breaking the land speed record on the Bonneville Salt Flats -- Hopkins takes us along for the ride every minute of this movie. The fact that this film is based on the true story of Burt Munro makes it all the more captivating, but a lesser actor than Hopkins might very well have lost us along the way. It is no wonder that the children of the real-life Burt Munro were moved to tears by Hopkins' portrayal.<br/><br/>There's a clever ongoing bit about the taste of Burt's hot tea, and you will also wonder a bit about how his lemonade might taste. Every scene is a jewel in this movie, and the cumulative effect proves that extraordinary films do not have to cost bazillions of dollars and take two years of computer-generated special effects to WOW their audience.<br/><br/>Burt is challenged by every imaginable obstacle standing between him and his speed dream: his failing heart may give out any minute, the journey around the world to transport the 1920 Indian motorcycle to the USA seems insurmountable, he has no machine shop or whiz-bang tools and equipment to work his engineering miracles, etc. What he DOES have is an indomitable spirit that will never, ever stop trying. Whether he's battling young ruffians who diss his ancient motorcycle or banking, bureaucrats and red tape, he is a wrinkled but worthy warrior.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is as beautiful and bizarre as it gets, and the audience becomes inordinately fond and just about every one of them except for a nasty foreign cabdriver (Carlos Lacamara), but hey, somebody had to be disliked. Great actors in small roles abound, including Diane Ladd as Ada, a frontier gal that's been lonely a while, Saginaw Grant as Jake, an \"Indian\" with a really distasteful solution to Burt's prostate problems, and Paul Rodriguez as Fernando, a human and humane used car salesman. Perhaps the best scene -- and heart -- stealer is Chris Williams as Tina, a cross-dressing front desk night clerk at a fleabag hooker hotel. You gotta love him. Or her, as the case may be. Stellar performance, and Hopkins' Burt treats Tina with such dignity it defines friendship.<br/><br/>Don't miss this fine, fine film. And if there is justice in the boffo box office world, The World's Fastest Indian will be a true Oscar contender in 2006.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"The World's Fastest Indian\", directed by Roger Donaldson, is a thrilling and heartwarming film based on the true story of Burt Munro, played brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins. The movie takes us through Munro's journey as he sets out to break the land speed record with his home-built 1920s Indian motorcycle. \n\nHopkins' performance is nothing short of exceptional, bringing depth and warmth to the character of Munro. He masterfully portrays the determination, passion, and eccentricity that made Munro such an endearing figure. Supporting actors Olivia Williams and William Moseley also deliver strong performances in their respective roles.\n    \nDonaldson expertly weaves together elements of adventure, comedy, and drama to create a truly captivating cinematic experience. The stunning New Zealand landscapes serve as the perfect backdrop for this inspiring tale of perseverance and triumph against all odds. Additionally, the soundtrack perfectly complements the mood and tone of each scene, adding another layer of emotional resonance.\n   \nOverall, \"The World's Fastest Indian\" is an entertaining and inspirational film that celebrates human ingenuity, resilience, and the power of dreams. It will leave you cheering for its lovable protagonist while reminding you of the importance of never giving up on your passions. Highly recommended for fans of biographical dramas and anyone looking for an uplifting cinema experience.",

It was founded in 1966 by civil engineer José María Garza Ponce after he decided to take advantage of the boom in public works that Mexico was experiencing during that time. In the early 1980s, the company nearly went out of business due to the country's debt crisis; during that decade, they built the first private industrial park in Nuevo León, and later tapped into different markets by partnering with transnational companies in multimillion-dollar construction projects. They are currently one of the largest construction firms in Mexico and one of the leading ones in the northern part of the country. In the early 2000s, Grupo Garza Ponce had a strong business relationship with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) based in Nuevo León, which granted them opportunities to participate in several construction projects, including the Puente de la Unidad bridge and the expansion of the Monterrey Metro. In the 2010s, they constructed industrial park projects in Nuevo León, the Mexico City Arena, and the football stadium Estadio BBVA Bancomer, home of Mexican top division team C.F. Monterrey.

        "human_text": "Fully convolutional deep neural networks have been asserted to be fast and\nprecise frameworks with great potential in image segmentation. One of the major\nchallenges in training such networks raises when data is unbalanced, which is\ncommon in many medical imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where\nlesion class voxels are often much lower in numbers than non-lesion voxels. A\ntrained network with unbalanced data may make predictions with high precision\nand low recall, being severely biased towards the non-lesion class which is\nparticularly undesired in most medical applications where FNs are more\nimportant than FPs. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem,\nmore recently similarity loss functions and focal loss. In this work we trained\nfully convolutional deep neural networks using an asymmetric similarity loss\nfunction to mitigate the issue of data imbalance and achieve much better\ntradeoff between precision and recall. To this end, we developed a 3D\nFC-DenseNet with large overlapping image patches as input and an asymmetric\nsimilarity loss layer based on Tversky index (using Fbeta scores).

        "direct_prompt": "This study presents a novel approach using asymmetric loss functions and deep densely connected networks for highly imbalanced medical image segmentation, specifically applied to multiple sclerosis lesion detection. The proposed method addresses the challenge of class imbalance by utilizing an adaptive threshold-based asymmetry factor that adjusts the contribution of foreground and background pixels in the loss function calculation. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional symmetric loss functions, achieving higher dice similarity coefficients and improved lesion boundary accuracy. This innovative technique has potential applications in other domains with similar class imbalance issues.",

        "human_text": " The year is 1529, and Brian Duffy, a world-weary Irish mercenary soldier is hired in Venice by the mysterious Aurelianus to go to Vienna and work as a bouncer at the Zimmerman Inn, former monastery and current brewery of the famous Herzwesten beer. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Turkish army under Sultan Suleiman I has achieved its most advanced position yet in their march into Europe, and is poised to capture Vienna. With the Turkish army travels Ibrahim, a magician who intends to use horrific spells as part of the siege. Duffy spent some time in Vienna years ago, and as he returns, he is haunted by memories of past events, and now he also finds himself having visions of mythical creatures and being ambushed by shadowy people and demonic monsters. Upon arriving in Vienna, Duffy meets Epiphany, a former girlfriend from his previous time in Vienna, and her father, Gustav Vogel, who is working on a painting he calls \"The Death of St. Michael the Archangel\". It seems the painting is never quite complete, and the elder Vogel is continuously adding additional detail to the work, causing it to gradually become more and more obscure. Then Duffy finds himself not only drafted into the city's defensive army, but also led by Aurelianus down mystical paths from the surprisingly old Herzwesten brewery to even more ancient caves beneath the city, in search of defenses against the approaching army and clues to Duffy's very nature. As it turns out, Aurelianus knows more about Duffy and his past than Duffy himself knows, and his real purpose in hiring him is to protect the hidden Fisher King, secret spiritual leader of the western world, and to defend him and the West against the Turkish advance in the siege of Vienna. And the real reason that it's critical that Vienna not be captured by the Turks is because it's the site of the Herzwesten brewery. The Herzwesten light and bock beers are famous throughout Europe, but the dark beer, produced only every eight hundredth year, has supernatural properties and must not be allowed to fall into enemy hands. Meanwhile, others are drawn to Vienna in anticipation of significant events. The so-called \"dark birds\", magically sensitive individuals from far flung corners of the world, arrive in the city hoping for a sip of the Herzwesten dark, and a small group of middle-aged Vikings have improbably sailed their ship up the Danube River to Vienna, having sensed the possibility that the prophesied final battle of Ragnarok will take place here.",

        "direct_prompt": "Yes, it's possible for anxiety to cause symptoms even when you're not conscious of feeling anxious. This is because anxiety can be triggered by subconscious thoughts or experiences that we're not aware of, and these triggers can lead to physical sensations such as sweating, racing heart, or trembling. Additionally, some people may experience generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) which causes them to feel constantly on edge without any specific trigger.

        "human_text": "Mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing, all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players, say two reports.\nDespite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said Jupiter. A separate study by Gartner has also said real-time TV broadcasts to mobiles is \"unlikely\" in Europe until 2007. Technical issues and standards must be resolved first, said the report. Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others. Bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life.\nFifty percent of Europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. \"Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,\" said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter research. \"Mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches.\" Other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones, compared to portable players which can hold up to 40GB of music. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster and other net music download services.\nWith phones getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to be able to watch TV on the move. In the US, services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones. But, the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. Currently, TV-like services, where clips are downloaded, are offered by several European operators, like Italy's TIM and 3. Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report.\nVarious standards and ways of getting TV signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. In Europe, trials in Berlin and Helsinki are making use of terrestrial TV masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. The service uses 3GP technology, one of the standards for mobile TV. But at the end of 2004, the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe. Operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. The cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. Handsets also need to be able to work with the DVB-H standard. TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner. Digital video recorders, like Europe's Sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what TV they watch. As a result, people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. A report by analysts InStat/MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. It says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.",

According to industry analysts, while mobiles have made significant strides towards becoming all-inclusive entertainment devices, they still lack certain features that are essential for them to truly compete with dedicated media players such as iPods or other handheld gaming consoles.\n\nOne major factor holding back mobile phones from being recognized as full-fledged media players is their limited storage capacity compared to traditional MP3 players. While some high end smartphones may offer up to 64GB of internal memory, most basic models come equipped with only 8 - 16 GB which can quickly fill up when storing large files like movies or TV shows.

Shake off excess water. Using a sharp knife, separate the entire stem from each leaf, reserving both the leaves and stems in separate piles. Trim the bottoms of the stems if necessary. Lay stems flat in a single bunch and cut through the center to separate the small upper portion from the fat bottom portion. Take the half with the large bottom stems, and carefully split each stem piece in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Lay the stem pieces down horizontally and slice them very thin (about 2 mm), working with no more than 5-6 pieces at a time. Heat the butter in a large (about 12\") skillet that can be covered later with a lid. Meanwhile, mince the shallot. When the butter has just started to brown, add the shallot and all of the stem pieces. Immediately turn the heat to low and stir gently to evenly distribute across the bottom of the pan. Adjusting the heat as necessary, saute the shallot and stem pieces very slowly until caramelized, crispy, and very aromatic, about 45 minutes. Stir no more than once every 15 minutes to promote caramelization. Monitor the heat carefully to prevent burning. Towards the end of the cooking process, chop the reserved kale leaves crosswise into 1 inch strips. Remove stems and any remaining liquid to a separate bowl. Increase heat to medium high and bring the white wine to a boil. Allow to boil for 1-2 minutes to burn off the alcohol, then add the strips of kale leaves, a generous pinch of coarse kosher salt, a small pinch of red pepper flakes, and a turn of fresh ground black pepper. Stir quickly to combine, then cover the skillet and reduce heat to low. Cook covered for 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice during cooking. Remove the lid from the skillet, and transfer the kale leaves to a serving bowl using tongs. Dress with a drizzle of walnut oil, white wine vinegar, and a few drops of fresh lemon juice.

My landlord contacted me about it, but the check showed up a few days later, so I figured it was fine - I’ve paid on time for two years, this was a fluke. I didn’t want it to happen again, and I know the mail has been slower lately, so I started mailing my rent checks earlier. Last month I mailed the check on the 15th so there would be plenty of time, but a few days ago the landlord contacted me to say it hadn’t arrived. I was so frustrated. I figured it must have been lost in the mail since it had been nearly three weeks, so I sent another rent check. I wanted to send it with tracking, but I was told the only way to do that was to require a signature, and I was afraid my landlord wouldn’t be home to sign for it and that would cause additional delay, so I sent it normally. Since this is the second time in a year this has happened, I’m worried my landlord will think I’m a bad or unreliable tenant and not renew my lease, or will raise my rent a lot.

The group was founded in 2010 by a team of concerned citizens who were frustrated with the lack of oversight in government agencies, particularly at the federal level.\n\nThe organization's name is derived from the famous quote attributed to Lord Acton: \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"[2] Hewhocorrupts takes this idea one step further, arguing that not only does power have the potential to corrupt those who hold it, but also that corruption can spread throughout entire institutions if left unchecked. As such, the group focuses on exposing instances of corruption within government agencies and advocating for stronger anti-corruption measures.\n\nOne of hewhocorrupts' main initiatives has been its annual Government Accountability Awards,[3] which recognize individuals and organizations that have made significant contributions towards promoting integrity and fighting corruption in public life. Past recipients include whistleblowers, journalists, activists, and politicians who have demonstrated exceptional courage and commitment to upholding ethical standards in their work.\n\nIn addition to these awards, hewhocorrupts engages in various advocacy campaigns aimed at raising awareness about specific issues related to governmental corruption. For example, during the 2016 presidential election cycle, the group launched a campaign called #DrainTheSwamp[4], which focused on calling attention to what they saw as endemic corruption within Washington D.C.'s political establishment. This effort helped spark a broader conversation around the country about the need for reform in our nation's capital.\n\nDespite facing criticism from some quarters for being overly partisan or radical, hewhocorrupts remains committed to its mission of promoting honesty, transparency, and responsibility in governance. Through its ongoing efforts, the organization hopes to help create a more accountable and trustworthy system of government that serves the needs of all Americans.[5]\"",

        "human_text": "Cyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for Christmas shoppers.\nForecasts predict that British people will spend £4bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64% on 2003. Surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online. Savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in High Street stores.\nAlmost half of the UK population now shop online according to figures collected by the Interactive Media in Retail Group which represents web retailers. About 85% of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their Christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group. On average each shopper will spend £220 and Britons lead Europe in their affection for online shopping.\nAlmost a third of all the money spent online this Christmas will come out of British wallets and purses compared to 29% from German shoppers and only 4% from Italian gift buyers. James Roper, director of the IMRG, said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as LCD television sets and digital cameras. Mr Roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for Christmas. He advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular. A survey by Hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends. Much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm Saint Bernard Software. The research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer. Worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket, suggests the research, who will spend up to five hours per week in December browsing and buying at online shops.\nIggy Fanlo, chief revenue officer at Shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping. \"When you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher,\" he said. Higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster, he said, which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy.\nThe behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said. \"The single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,\" he said. \"The number one reason now is convenience.\" \"Very few consumers click on the lowest price,\" he said. \"They are looking for good prices and merchant reliability.\" Consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service. Data collected by eBay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. According to eBay UK there are now more than 150 Robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. The Robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores. Similarly many shoppers are turning to eBay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline PlayStation 2, which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. The high demand for the PlayStation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up. In shops the PS2 is supposed to sell for £104.99. In some eBay UK auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure. Many people are also using eBay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country. The portable version of the PlayStation has only just gone on sale in Japan yet some enterprising eBay users are selling the device to UK gadget fans.",

With more people than ever before turning to the web to find the perfect present, it's clear that this trend shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nOne of the main reasons behind this surge in internet-based gift buying is convenience. Gone are the days where you had to traipse around busy high streets or crowded shopping centers in search of something suitable – now all it takes is a few clicks on your computer or smartphone, and voila! Your gift problem is solved.\n\nAnother factor driving the growth of digital gift giving is choice. The internet offers an almost limitless selection of items from which to choose, meaning that even the pickiest of recipients should be able to find something they'll love. From unique handmade crafts to personalized gifts, there truly is something for everyone when shopping online.\n\nIn addition, with so much competition among ecommerce sites, prices tend to be lower than what you would find in physical stores. This means shoppers can save money while still treating their loved ones to something special.\n\nHowever, despite its numerous benefits, some consumers remain hesitant about purchasing gifts online due to concerns over delivery times and potential issues with returns. But as more retailers offer expedited shipping options and hassle-free return policies, these worries are becoming less prevalent.\n\nOverall, it seems that the future of gifting lies firmly within the realm of cyberspace. As technology continues to evolve and improve, we can expect even more innovation and excitement in the world of online gift shopping. So why not give it a try yourself? You might just discover your new favorite way to show someone how much you care.",

Be sure to beat the eggs until they reach this temperature at which salmonella bacteria is killed. This will take about 10 to 15 minutes. Be sure to move the beater around the bowl so the eggs cook evenly; there will be quite a bit of spattering. TO SERVE THE ZABAGLIONE: Transfer the mixture to wine glasses and serve immediately accompanied by ladyfingers or Italian cookies known as \"Savoiardi.\" An alternative way to serve this is to take slices of pound cake or panettone and set them on a broiler pan. Cover the cake slices with a layer of sliced strawberries or peeled Comice pear, and ladle a portion of the zabaglione over the fruit. Broil the slices for a minute or until the zabaglione is bubbling and lightly browned. Serve immediately.",

I went to therapy, with different people all telling me my feelings were somewhat irrelevant as I had \"a nice life, a nice family and friends\". I lost all trust in psychiatrists from then on, even though I know I need help, I would rather keep considering killing myself instead of putting that dread and huge feeling of inadequacy back into it. I'd always told myself that I'd wait until my mum died as the harm that would cause her would have huge repercussions, she would absolutely blame herself.  But now, I have absolutely no friends, I can't find a decent job and every day I wake up with the total feeling of dread of not wanting to continue on. My issues with how we've built our society won't ever change, the lack of trust I've developed with people, and especially those supposedly there \"to help\" won't ever change, my lack of empathy towards others won't change, so what's the point in going on? I can't really find it, and I'm starting to get tired of the selflessness I've felt in not doing this earlier, I've wasted my life and I don't want to keep going. I think I might finally bite the bullet and not think of the repercussions. Life has no purpose, I have no purpose, I'm just really starting to lose it.

It's not worth causing such suffering; even if things seem hopeless now, there may still be reasons to keep living tomorrow.

The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension.

This approach can be seen in several ways. Teacher candidates who are learning to become teachers are asked to co-teach with experienced associate teachers, whereby the classroom responsibilities are shared, and the teacher candidate can learn from the associate teacher. Regular classroom teachers and special education teachers can be paired in co-teaching relationships to benefit inclusion of students with special needs. To evaluate the effectiveness of co-teaching, partnerships can use the Magiera-Simmons Quality Indicator Model of Co-Teaching, which gives standard definitions for co-teaching skills through 25 quality indicators and a rating scale.

A few days after the bonfire and the release of the infamous \"list,\" Kyle is trying reconnect with Amanda Bloom, while Lori struggles with her own relationship to Declan, who has become distant unexpectedly. After a freshman student cuts through a park near the school, he finds himself being chased by a football jock, who catches up with him on school grounds and brutally attacks him. When Kyle sees the student in trouble, he immediately steps in and delays the larger and more muscular jock with ease. Immediately Kyle's popularity rises, which quickly has an unintentional effect on Josh, who has grown jealous of Kyle's new status. Kyle's popularity jumps once more when he is nominated for school student government president. Once learning of the job and responsibility required, he believes he can live in Baylin's words and make a difference, while also winning back Amanda. Josh grows even more jealous of Kyle and wants to find a way to get himself noticed, against Andy's best advice. While Kyle is excited at the thought of becoming school president, his trainer, Tom Foss, disagrees. Foss believes that the election could be a trap meant to lure Kyle out into the open. Foss attempts to teach Kyle to see through an object, a talent Baylin used only once and discovered shortly before his death. Upon the end of the training session, Foss presents Kyle with Baylin's journal hoping it will bring Kyle to his senses, but the early entries only exaggerated Kyle's quest to make a difference. As Kyle prepared to run for the election, Lori used her newly self-appointed position as campaign manager to avoid thinking about her failing relationship with Declan, and avoid the fact that she really isn't over Declan. Josh attempts to hatch a scheme to bring himself into the center of attention, as everyone goading over how awesome Kyle was had begun to prey on his mind. Against Andy's judgment, Josh sneaks into the school at night and steals the donkey and elephant stuffed animals put out every year during the election, previously thought to be impossible. On the day of the election, every student was impressed with the prank Josh performed, only another student tried to take responsibility; Josh foolishly told the students the prank was his own idea. As Kyle began his speech, the assembly chanted for a Trager, but Josh, not Kyle, and Josh was escorted from the assembly and disciplined. Kyle's speech went over extremely well, and it seemed Kyle was a shoo-in for victory, but when Kyle discovered a strange metallic device in his backpack, and read more of Baylin's journal, he realized how dangerous being in the spotlight had become. After flushing the device down the toilet, Kyle made his way to the votes room, attempting to prevent himself from winning, but a locked door stood in his way. Finally realizing what all his training had been for, Kyle used telekinesis to toss out some of his votes. When being brought on stage to announce the winner, Kyle feels incredibly sick, collapses and goes into seizures. When the ambulance arrives, Foss sneaks aboard and changes Kyle's test and symptoms to dissuade any questions. Kyle realizes that he must stay under the radar to avoid bringing any danger to himself or the Tragers. Josh's parents reconcile with him, realizing that they all had got swept up by Kyle's success.

The Da Vinci Code is being made into a film starring Tom Hanks. Angels and Demons was written before The Da Vinci Code, which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, and been translated into more than 40 languages, since it was released in 2003. Angels and Demons is set mainly in Rome as symbologist Robert Langdon follows a 400-year-old trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood, The Illuminati, to blow up the Vatican.\nThe novel deals with moral issues such as the debate between science and religion and also seeks to uncover some of the mysteries surrounding the Pope. On his website, Brown wrote: \"I think the reason Angels and Demons is raising eyebrows right now is that it opens some Vatican closets most people don't even know exist. \"But I think most people understand that an organisation as old and powerful as the Vatican could not possibly have risen to power without acquiring a few skeletons in their closets.\" Such is the success of The Da Vinci Code in France, special tours have been organised to trace Langdon's footsteps, including the the Louvre museum and the Saint Sulpice Church. The Louvre has also given permission for parts of the film version to be shot in the museum.

His  (1878–82) is still considered the principal work on the coinage of the crusades. He was awarded the medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1903. A large portion of his extensive Crusader coin collection is housed in the Cabinet des Médailles a department of the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. Biography\nHe was born in Guebwiller, Alsace, then part of France but later annexed to Germany. From 1863 he studied medicine in Paris. During the Franco-Prussian War, he served on the French side as a medic. In 1871 he returned to Paris, and was awarded a doctorate in 1872 for a thesis on the respiratory tract. After this he travelled extensively in North Africa, Syria, Asia Minor, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Italy (visiting also Germany) and then turned to research into the history of the Crusader states and the Byzantine Empire. He was elected president of the Societé des Antiquaires de France.  In 1884 he was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.

At age 16, he began working for his father's company as an apprentice.[1]\n\nIn 1862, at just eighteen years old, Schlumberger moved to Paris to continue his education[2]. There, he attended classes at École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures while also assisting with research projects conducted by professors from various universities including Pierre Curie who would later go onto win Nobel Prizes himself [3][4]. His work during this time focused primarily around electromagnetism theory; specifically how it related to wire insulation materials used within communication devices such as telephones or telegraphs - something very relevant considering what industry field today! \n\nDuring Franco-Prussian War(1870),Schlumberger served briefly but afterwards returned home whereupon resumed studies/research interests until being appointed Professor Extraordinary position University Strasbourg then subsequently becoming Ordinary professor there too after receiving Phd degree summa cum laude under guidance Professeur Henri Victor Regnault known mainly due their collaboration developing new methods analyzing petroleum samples taken well cores using microscope techniques microscopy thus leading way modern petrophysics branch geology concerned study physical properties rocks fluids found beneath Earth surface especially those relating fluid extraction industries like oil gas exploration production drilling operations etcetera.\n    \nAfter several successful academic appointments throughout Europe particularly Germany Switzerland Italy Austria Hungary Poland Romania Russia Turkey Greece Bulgaria Serbia Bosnia Herzegovina Montenegro Albania Croatia Slovenia Slovakia Czech Republic Ukraine Belarus Lithuania Latvia Estonia Finland Sweden Denmark Norway Iceland Ireland United Kingdom Canada USA Japan South Korea Australia New Zealand China Taiwan Hong Kong Singapore Thailand Vietnam Malaysia Philippines Indonesia Brunei Sri Lanka India Bangladesh Nepal Pakistan Bhutan Maldives Myanmar Burma Mongolia North Koreasouth korea Democratic People’s Republika Korea, Dr schlumbergers contributions include development first electric drill bit rotary system ever created revolutionizing entire process hydrocarbon resource extractions worldwide still widely utilized present day among major advancements credited him includes invention dynamoelectric",

By replacing the fully connected layers in CNN with 1\nby 1 convolution kernels, FCNN takes whole images as inputs and directly\noutputs segmentation maps by one pass of forward propagation. It has the\nproperty of translation invariance like patch-by-patch scanning but with much\nlower computation cost. Once FCNN is learned, it can process input images of\nany sizes without warping them to a standard size. These attractive properties\nmake it extendable to other general image segmentation problems. Based on FCNN,\na multi-stage deep learning is proposed to integrate appearance and motion cues\nfor crowd segmentation. Both appearance filters and motion filers are\npretrained stage-by-stage and then jointly optimized. Different combination\nmethods are investigated. The effectiveness of our approach and component-wise\nanalysis are evaluated on two crowd segmentation datasets created by us, which\ninclude image frames from 235 and 11 scenes, respectively.

Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining real-time processing speeds.

        "human_text": " The book begins immediately after the partition decision was announced. The Jews flooded the streets of Palestine, celebrating. However, the Jewish leaders immediately began planning for war. Ehud Avriel was sent to Prague to buy arms in the name of Ethiopia. Meanwhile, the Jews built an army and air force from scratch. The Jewish leaders, like David Ben-Gurion, knew that, due to military shortcomings, the conflict could only be won through intelligence warfare. The Arabs vowed to put Jerusalem under siege, and did. For many months Jerusalem survived on very limited foodstuffs. On the Arab side, Captain Abdul-Aziz Kerine bought arms in Prague in the name of Syria, the only sovereign Arab nation at the time. The Arab countries (Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Transjordan) discussed their plan of action. They agreed to work together, but everyone, especially King Abdullah of Transjordan, had their own agenda. In the end, the Arab states' lack of cooperation led to their downfall. There was a lot of disorganization and non-cooperation on the Jewish side as well. The main Jewish army was the Haganah, however the Stern Gang and Irgun were other Jewish militant groups. The groups had conflicting ideals (for example: the Haganah was willing to internationalize Jerusalem in order to have a unified, peaceful state, but Jerusalem was of the utmost importance to the Stern Gang and the Irgun), but they managed to retain more organization and cooperation than the Arab armies.In the main text of O Jerusalem!, it is related that the Stern Gang and the Irgun massacred the Arab village of Deir Yassin, outraging Arabs and Jews alike. The Haganah denounced the massacre, but the Arabs believed the Haganah to be responsible and retaliated at the Jewish kibbutz of Kfar Etzion. Collins and Lapierre also acknowledged that other eyewitness accounts claim that the event at Deir Yassin was a battle and not a massacre. As May 15 drew closer, the two peoples continued preparing for war. However, the Jewish intelligence learned that, although the mandate was set to expire on May 15, the British were planning to leave on May 14. Prepared for the early departure, the Haganah mobilized quickly and managed to capture many British buildings before the Arabs even realized that the British had left. Not privy to this intelligence, the Arab armies activated on May 15. The Jewish homeland of Israel was declared on Iyar 5, 5708 Hebrew, or May 14, 1948 Gregorian. Today, this day is celebrated as Yom Ha'atzmaut, or Israeli Independence Day. After the expiration of the mandate, war befell the region. The Arab armies underestimated the Haganah's strength and were not prepared for a strong foe. Both the Arab and Jewish armies suffered major shortcomings in ammunition and manpower. The situation in Jerusalem worsened, leaving Jewish Jerusalemites near starving. On June 11, 1948 a UN sanctioned cease-fire began. Jerusalem's starving were saved by a temporary end to the siege. Jerusalem's storerooms and stomachs were filled again. By cease-fire agreement, neither army was allowed to re-arm itself, but the Haganah was able to buy arms through the black market. The Arab armies, however, were not. After four weeks, the fighting began again, followed by another cease-fire beginning on July 19 (July 17 in Jerusalem), 1948 (O Jerusalem! Collins).",

RHB, Malaysia's third-biggest lender, is already scouting for a foreign partner for its new Islamic banking unit, the firm told Reuters. The moves put Malaysia ahead of a 2007 deadline to open up the sector. The country's deal to join the World Trade Organisation set that year as a deadline for liberalisation of Islamic banking. Also on Tuesday, the central bank released growth figures showing Malaysia's economy expanded 7.1% in 2004. But growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter to 5.6%, and the central bank said it expected 6% expansion in 2005.\nMalaysia changed the law to allow Islamic banking in 1983. It has granted licences to three Middle Eastern groups, which - along with local players - mean there are eight fully-operational Islamic banking groups in the country.

However, proponents argue that lifting the restriction could boost competition within the industry and attract more investment from abroad.\n\nFinance Minister Lim Guan Eng said during a press conference: “We believe this is an important step towards enhancing competitiveness among our domestic banking sector while also attracting international players into our market.” He added that the change was part of efforts to modernize the country's financial system and increase access to financing for small businesses.\n\nOpposition parties have criticized the move, arguing that it goes against the principles of Islam and may lead to increased speculation and corruption in the finance industry. Some Muslim scholars have also expressed concern about potential conflicts between shariah laws and conventional banking practices.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad defended the decision, saying that it aligns with his administration’s goal of promoting economic growth through open markets and attracting foreign direct investment.\n\nThe announcement came as welcome news to some analysts who see greater participation by global firms as key to boosting innovation and professionalism in Malaysia's $200 billion Islamic finance industry.",

Sausage calls bun a b***h.<br/><br/>It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.<br/><br/>I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.<br/><br/>There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying.

Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.<br/><br/>There was a graphic rape scene.<br/><br/>I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.<br/><br/>You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.<br/><br/>Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.<br/><br/>Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.<br/><br/>There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.<br/><br/>A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.<br/><br/>My fingers hurt from typing.<br/><br/>If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.<br/><br/>If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID.

Existing CNN-based segmentation\nmethods mainly focus on looking for increasingly powerful network\narchitectures, but pay less attention to data sampling strategies for training\nnetworks more effectively. In this paper, we present a simple but effective\nsample selection method for training multi-organ segmentation networks. Sample\nselection exhibits an exploitation-exploration strategy, i.e., exploiting hard\nsamples and exploring less frequently visited samples. Based on the fact that\nvery hard samples might have annotation errors, we propose a new sample\nselection policy, named Relaxed Upper Confident Bound (RUCB). Compared with\nother sample selection policies, e.g., Upper Confident Bound (UCB), it exploits\na range of hard samples rather than being stuck with a small set of very hard\nones, which mitigates the influence of annotation errors during training. We\napply this new sample selection policy to training a multi-organ segmentation\nnetwork on a dataset containing 120 abdominal CT scans and show that it boosts\nsegmentation performance significantly.",

        "human_text": " The book suggests that, whereas the majority of the 5-billion people in the \"developing world\" are getting richer at an unprecedented rate, a group of countries (mostly in Africa and Central Asia but with a smattering elsewhere) are stuck and that development assistance should be focused heavily on them. These countries typically suffer from one or more development traps. The Conflict Trap: Civil wars (with an estimated average cost of $64bn each) and coups incur large economic costs to a country. Additionally, in the time period immediately following a major conflict, relapse is highly likely. Collier also argues that the longer a country stays in a state of conflict, the more players become established that profit from the state of tumult, making the situation increasingly intractable. The Natural Resource Trap: Countries that are rich in natural resources are paradoxically usually worse off than countries that are not. Collier attributes this to a variety of causes: * Resources make conflict for the resources more likely. * Natural resources mean that a government does not have to tax its citizens. Consequently, the citizenry are less likely to demand financial accountability from the government. * The exploitation of valuable natural resources can result in Dutch disease, where a country's other industries become less competitive as a result of currency valuation due to the revenue raised from the resource. Landlocked with Bad Neighbours: Poor landlocked countries with poor neighbours find it almost impossible to tap into world economic growth. Collier explains that countries with coastline trade with the world, while landlocked countries only trade with their neighbors. Landlocked countries with poor infrastructure connections to their neighbors therefore necessarily have a limited market for their goods. Bad Governance in a Small Country: Terrible governance and policies can destroy an economy with alarming speed. The reason small countries are at a disadvantage is that though they may have a low cost-of-living, and therefore be ideal for labor-intensive work, their smallness discourages potential investors, who are unfamiliar with the local conditions and risks, who instead opt for better known countries like China and India. He suggests a number of relatively inexpensive but institutionally difficult changes: # Aid agencies should increasingly be concentrated in the most difficult environments, accept more risk. Ordinary citizens should not support poorly informed vociferous lobbies whose efforts are counterproductive and severely constrain what the Aid agencies can do. # Appropriate Military Interventions (such as the British in Sierra Leone) should be encouraged, especially to guarantee democratic governments against coups. # International Charters are needed to encourage good governance and provide prototypes. # Trade Policy needs to encourage free trade and give preferential access to Bottom Billion exports. The book does not include a list of bottom billion countries because Collier believes this might lead to a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\" However, he states that there are 58 such countries mentioned throughout the book. In his book Wars, Guns, and Votes, Collier lists the Bottom Billion, to \"focus international effort\": Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Kazakhstan, Kenya, North Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.",

December's confidence level was below that seen in September, the Bank of Japan said. However, September's reading was the strongest for 13 years. \"The economy is at a pause but unlikely to fall\", the economy minister said. \"It will feel a bit slower (next year) than this year, and growth may be a bit more gentle but the situation is that the recovery will continue,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. In the Bank of Japan's December survey, the balance of big manufacturers saying business conditions are better, minus those saying they are worse, was 22, down from 26 in September.\nJapan's economy grew by just 0.1% in the three months to September, according revised data issued this month. With the recovery slowing, the world's second biggest economy is now expected grow by 0.2% in 2004. The Tankan index is based on a survey of 10,227 firms. Big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005; their views suggest the March reading could go as low as 15 - still in positive territory, but weaker. The dollar's decline has strengthened the yen, making Japanese exports more expensive in the US. China's attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit Japanese industry's sales abroad. Confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the March survey. Nonetheless, Japanese firms have been stepping up capital investment, and the survey found the pace is quickening. Companies reported they expect to invest 7.7% more in the year to March 2005 than the previous year - up from expectations of 6.1% increase in the September Tankan.",

Some also expressed concern over the lackluster domestic demand.\n\nHowever, despite the decline in confidence, firms continued to report profitable earnings due to cost-cutting measures and restructuring efforts.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe's government is hoping to boost consumer spending through fiscal stimulus packages and structural reforms aimed at revitalizing the economy. But some experts say more needs to be done to address the underlying issues facing the country's stagnant economy.\n\nOverall, the latest survey results suggest that while Japanese businesses remain resilient, they are increasingly cautious about the future amid growing uncertainties both domestically and globally.",

The move comes as part of the company's efforts to cut costs and improve profitability amid fierce competition in the industry.\n\nAccording to sources close to the matter, the majority of the job cuts will affect France, Italy, and Poland, with factories producing refrigerators, washing machines, and cookers set to be shut down over the next two years. While no exact numbers have been provided, local unions estimate that up to 4,000 workers could lose their jobs as a result of the decision.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, Electrolux acknowledged the difficult situation faced by its employees but emphasized the need for structural changes within the company. \"We understand this is an extremely challenging time for those affected,\" said the spokesperson. \"However, we must adapt our operations to meet changing market conditions and customer demands.\"\n\nThe Swedish government has criticized the move, arguing that it undermines the country's commitment to protecting worker rights and preserving industrial jobs. Minister for Enterprise and Innovation Mikael Odenberg called on Electrolux to reconsider its decision and work collaboratively with employee representatives to find alternative solutions.\n\nDespite the backlash, Electrolux remains committed to its plan, citing increasing globalization and intense price competition as key drivers behind the restructuring initiative. Shares of the company rose slightly following the announcement, indicating investor confidence in the long-term viability of the business strategy.",

If you thought the original was \"too much\", well, this one will truly give you more reasons to avoid it for it's vulgar content and crude sex jokes. That's for you, easily offended people. <br/><br/>I had a great time with it when it first came out in theaters. I really liked the crude sex humor and vulgar spoofs. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological humor, you will be amused.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is truly hilarious and in my opinion, the best part of the movie. It was about time that the \"Scary Movie\" franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was great. James Woods in the role of Father Merrin delivers a hysterical performance relying most of his scenes on scatological humor and profanity. For example, when Reagan says \"f*** me\" and he immediately jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating her. Another example is the line where Reagan's mother says \"she won't even let me touch her!\" and the priest responds \"yeah sometimes that happens, you have to give candy to the children\" (or something like that); obviously referring to recent pederastry cases. On the other side, the movie also has \"classical\" but always effective teen humor . For example, when entering the room for the first time, he gets scared and runs away when Reagan turns her head on 180º; and the always effective vomiting cycle. <br/><br/>After the Exorcist spoof, the movie centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's when the movie takes a new direction and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs from popular t.v. commercials, songs (Vitamin C), and even racist and homophobic jokes. The sex jokes worth a watch specially on the infamous clown scene, and the sex ghost. <br/><br/>\"Scary Movie 2\" does not \"cross\" the line on the vulgar factor. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. But be sure to watch it on DVD; do not watch the t.v. version because it's very cut (specially on dialogs).<br/><br/>This is in my opinion the best of the \"Scary Movies\".",

        "human_text": "The Display Handicap was an American long distance Thoroughbred horse race held annually from 1955 through 1990. A race for 3-year-olds and up, it was run at the Jamaica Race Course from inception through 1958 at a distance of 2 miles. In 1959 the race was moved permanently to the newly renovated Aqueduct Racetrack after which the Jamaica track was closed and the property sold to real estate developers. From 1959 through 1969 it was contested at 2 miles then its final two decades was run at a distance of 2¼ miles. The Display Handicap was traditionally held on the last day of racing in New York City for that calendar year. It began ending the season on December 31, 1976, when year-round racing was introduced in New York. The race was aptly named for Display, a son of Fair Play (as was Man o' War, elected #1 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century). Display was noted for being able to carry heavy weights over marathon distances successfully. The Display Handicap was distinctive for the fact that many horses who normally ran in claiming races (but possessed abundant stamina) would be entered in it, and a few such horses went on to win the event. In 1978, Seaney Bear nosed out Framarco, another horse who ran mostly in claiming races. They competed in one of the two divisions of the race which were run in that year, necessitated by an unusually high number of horses entered in the race. Although the race was for 3-year-olds and up, it was rare for a 3-year-old to win it; when In the Ruff won the 1983 running he became the first 3-year-old winner of the Display since Dean Carl in 1963, and the first ever at the 2¼-mile distance.",

However, obtaining\nmedical image datasets is very difficult and expensive, and full annotation of\n3D medical image is a monotonous and time-consuming work.

The\ncomparative experiments with three different strategies using datasets from the\ndeveloping human connectome project (dHCP) show that, our strategy only needs\n15% to 20% annotated slices in brain extraction task and 30% to 35% annotated\nslices in tissue segmentation task to achieve comparative results as full\nannotation.",

Organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time.\nProducer Brian Grazer presented the award to Spurlock and the film's backers, Roadside Attractions, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Showtime Independent Films.

        "human_text": "Historically there were two great United States Naval mutinies. In 1842 a naval sloop, the U.S.S. Somers, had a court martial for three crew members (one, Midshipman Philip Spencer, was the son of Secretary of War John Canfield Spencer), which ended with their being found guilty and hanged. To this day there is debate if Spencer (a troubled youth) was even serious about seizing the \"Somers\". The other occurred in 1944 at Port Chicago, California, when, a few weeks after a terrible accident that killed many men loading ammunition on a boat, their replacements refused to work under existing unsafe conditions. This led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision - against the workers, who claimed they were not under military law. <br/><br/>But the best known mutiny in the American navy is that on the U.S.S. Caine, during the hurricane that preceded the battle of Okinawa. That this is a fictional mutiny does not seem to attract any attention. THE CAINE MUTINY was a successful novel, Broadway play (\"THE CAINE MUTINY COURT MARTIAL\") and a great movie. It remains the American equivalent of the mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty.<br/><br/>The performances of the leads, Bogart, Johnson, MacMurray (his second of three great heels), Ferrer, Tully, and E.G.Marshall are all first rate, as are the supporting cast (which includes Lee Marvin, Claude Atkins, and Jerry Paris - all of whom had quite substantial careers after this film). Only Robert Francis did not have a substantial career after his fine Ensign Keith - he died in a plane crash in 1955.<br/><br/>There are mental images from the film (mostly connected to Bogart's Queeg) that people remember - even spoof. Every time you see some character showing nervous ticks, if he or she pulls out a pair of small metal balls and roll them in their hand, it is a salute to Bogie's originally doing it in THE CAINE MUTINY. And his magnificent moment of success: \"the strawberries\", and how he proved the theft with geometric precision, remains a signal that the person speaking has too many fixations.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the film makes Queeg better (if still sick) than the play does. When cross examined by Greenwald at the court martial of Maryk and Keith, Queeg is asked about whether or not he overused his right to free transport of liquor and other items from Hawaii to the mainland from the navy. Queeg at first denies it, but when Greenwald says he can bring in (as witnesses) people connected with the sale of the items and the transport of them, Queeg suddenly remembers that he might have. This is not in the film, but it shows that Queeg was not all that clean an officer.<br/><br/>That aside, the impact of the film is still terrific half a century after it was shot. It illustrates that personality flaws frequently causes the problems that affect all of us, and that we need more understanding of each other's problems to avoid the bigger ones. From a case of over-extended battle fatigue, the crew of a warship are driven to accept an act of mutiny against it's captain in an emergency situation. And it almost gets two officers disgraced or hanged.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"The Caine Mutiny\", directed by Edward Dmytryk, is a gripping and intense drama based on Herman Wouk's novel of the same name. The film follows Lieutenant Steve Maryk (Van Johnson), who takes over command of the USS Caine after Captain Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) becomes unstable due to his obsession with security. As tensions rise among the crew, a court martial is held to determine the fate of both Maryk and Queeg.\n\nBogart delivers a powerful performance as the troubled captain, bringing depth and complexity to the character. Meanwhile, Johnson holds his own against such a seasoned actor, showcasing his range as a leading man. The supporting cast, including José Ferrer and Fred MacMurray, also contribute strong performances that add to the overall intensity of the story.\n\nDmytryk expertly directs the film, creating a sense of unease and tension throughout. He effectively uses symbolism and imagery to convey the psychological turmoil experienced by the characters. Additionally, Robert Rossen's screenplay adapts the source material masterfully, capturing the nuances of Wouk's writing while condensing it into a tightly-paced narrative.\n\nOverall, \"The Caine Mutiny\" is a compelling and well-crafted film that explores themes of leadership, mental health, and morality. It stands as a classic example of Hollywood filmmaking at its finest.",

Previously he served in the government of Russia as Minister of Finance from 18 May 2000 to 26 September 2011. After graduating with degrees in finance and economics, Kudrin worked in the administration of Saint Petersburg's liberal Mayor Anatoly Sobchak. In 1996, he started working in the Presidential Administration of Boris Yeltsin. He was appointed as Finance Minister on 28 May 2000 and held the post for 11 years, making him the longest-serving Finance Minister in post-Soviet Russia. In addition, he was Deputy Prime Minister from 2000 to 2004 and again beginning in 2007. As Finance Minister, Kudrin was widely credited with prudent fiscal management, commitment to tax and budget reform and championing the free market. Under Kudrin, Russia's government paid most of the substantial foreign debt it had accumulated in the 1990s, leaving the country with one of the lowest foreign debts among major economies. Much of the revenue from exports was accumulated at the Stabilization Fund which helped Russia to come out of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis in a much better state than many experts expected. During his career, Kudrin has won several awards, including the \"Finance Minister of the Year 2010\" prize from Euromoney magazine. He was asked to resign from his position on 26 September 2011 by President Dmitry Medvedev.",

He served as the Minister of Finance from May 2000 to November 2011 and is widely regarded as one of the most influential economic policymakers in modern Russian history. \n\nKudrin graduated with honors from the Department of Applied Mathematics at Moscow State University before going on to earn his PhD in Economics there. In 1990, he joined the Ministry of Finance where he quickly rose through the ranks due to his expertise in budgetary policy and macroeconomic modeling. His tenure at the ministry culminated in his appointment as First Deputy Minister in 1998 under then-Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.\n \nIn 1999, when Vladimir Putin became President of Russia, he appointed Kudrin as Head of the Presidential Administration's Main Control Directorate responsible for overseeing government spending. The following year, Putin named him Minister of Finance - a position that Kudrin would hold until being replaced by Anton Siluanov in 2012. During this time, Alexey played an instrumental role in implementing policies aimed at stabilizing the country’s economy after years of turmoil caused by political instability and low oil prices. These efforts helped attract foreign investment back into Russia and laid the groundwork for its eventual inclusion in the G8 group of major industrialized nations.\n  \nUnder Kudrin's leadership, significant reforms were implemented including privatization of state assets such as Rosneft (the largest publicly traded oil company), streamlining tax codes which reduced rates while broadening bases thereby increasing revenue collection without stifling growth potential; introduction of value added taxes among others.[1] Additionally these measures led towards balancing budgets during global financial crisis[2]. Despite criticism within parliament regarding some aspects like high profile corruption cases involving officials close associates,[3][4] international organizations praised fiscal discipline demonstrated throughout period especially compared peers facing crises e.g Greece or Ireland [5].[6]   \n \n    \nAfter leaving office, Dr. Kudrin continued to be active in public life serving various roles advising both domestic private sector companies along side multilateral institutions namely International Monetary Fund IMF.

Let me just start out by saying that compared to today's standards and conventions, Craven's classic \"The Hills Have Eyes\" seems almost mild when compared to Alexandre Aja's remake. However, purists too skeptic to check this movie out should rest assured that the film is very, VERY faithful to the original. The characters, story, and overall progression of events remain unchanged, however, the quality of all said elements has increased dramatically since the original 70s release. Furthermore, like any other quality remake, there are twists, there are surprises, and for people who think they're getting the same film with updated technology, think again.<br/><br/>The film starts out with the nuclear bomb test-radiation disclaimer, and from there, to those who've screened the original, the familiar New Mexico desert setting is presented for all to take in. Make no mistakes, though. Aja never misses a beat, and he makes sure to take advantage of any opportunity he can when it comes to scaring the living crap out of the audience.<br/><br/>After a very vivid and graphic opening, the film gets rolling, mixing elements of freshness with both nostalgia and familiarity. People who saw the original will know what they're looking at, however their eyes will also be glued to the screen due to the overall difference in presentation and cinematography. The familiar gas station attendant is shown to the audience, and soon after, the Carter family + in-law stroll in. From there, the real fun begins.<br/><br/>Aja and his fellow screenwriter did an amazing job adding depth and dimension to the family members, ensuring that throughout the course of the film, people in the audience would certainly be able to connect with or identify with at least one member of the Carter family. This is accentuated by very strong performances by all the actors. Recognizable, seasoned actors are chosen for the older family members, while younger, relatively lesser known actors are chosen for characters like Bobby and Brenda.<br/><br/>I really could not complain with any of the performances. With all the craziness and gruesome things happening to the family, the actors' reactions are all portrayed very realistically, with emotions dead-on with very few hiccups in line delivery. One performance that stood out in particular to me was definitely that of Aaron Stanford (Pyro, X2 and the upcoming X-Men 3). Despite the fact that Standford was merely a year old when the original 'Hills' was released, he more than proves his acting credibility and fits the role of Doug very well. He does the role justice, and fills the shoes of the protagonist very well. I could go on and on about the performances of the rest of the cast (which are all extremely solid), but you want to know more about the movie, right? One cannot help but compare this film to original. There are 3 reasons I feel Aja's remake tops Craven's original: 1) the emphasis Aja places on the Carters, 2) the make-up effects, 3) the excessive gore.<br/><br/>Whereas Craven gave the deformed family clan plenty of screen time in 1977, Aja opts to shroud them in mystery for much of the film's duration. In many ways, the family emphasis is almost reversed in either film. Aja makes sure to hide the deformed family members from the viewers until just the proper moment, while Craven made their names and personalities as clear as day. I personally think the less information there is about something, the scarier it becomes to the person dealing with it. Aja realized this, and presented it very well.<br/><br/>Speaking of presentation, one cannot help but watch in sheer awe and amazement at some of the deformities displayed by the irradiated family members. I personally have not seen such drastically deformed individuals first hand, and I'm not sure how accurate their portrayals were in 'Hills' '06, but one thing is for sure: they were damn gruesome. Do not be fooled, the little child shown in the commercially televised trailer is NOT representative of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>And then there's the gore. Ah, the gore. Monsieur Aja, you are the brainchild of modern horror, and you definitely know how to ride with the best of them. No body part is taboo in this film, and for all you gore fanatics out there, there are no annoying instances where the camera \"looks away\" when someone or something is, say, struck with the menacing swing of a weapon. For all those who've said \"But I wanted to SEE what happened to him!\", rest assured, you will indeed see what happens to everything in this film.<br/><br/>The Hills '06 will satisfy your blood-lust. Alexandre Aja takes Craven's original film and builds on it in just about every way. Better acting, better visual effects, better make-up, better story presentation (i.e. no unanswered plot holes or abrupt \"halts\"), and much, MUCH more gore. This film is not for the squeamish, and it is my opinion that it will suppress the doubts of any skeptics who, upon seeing this film, may have badmouthed horror movie remakes in the past.<br/><br/>Only thing that caused me to dock it a point were the questionable courses of action some of the characters took. Alas, such things may always fall into the category of \"typical horror movie no-no's.\" Furthermore, I wasn't really horrified while watching this movie. A more accurate description would be that I was highly impressed and satisfied.<br/><br/>Horror movie fans: see this film as soon as you can. Non-horror movie fans: if you see this, prepare to have your world rocked.<br/><br/>See this movie people, it's pure gold.",

Ubaidur Rahman, an electrical engineer, was appointed by Syed Wajid Ali to head and develop this television project. Many pilot transmission tests were conducted. Then the control of this project was given to President Ayub Khan's government in 1962.

        "human_text": " Wimsey accepts an offer from the highly respectable management of Pym's Publicity, Ltd. (a light disguise for S. H. Bensons, where Sayers worked) to investigate a mystery and avert a scandal. Copywriter Victor Dean has died in a fall down the spiral iron office staircase, but he left a half-finished letter to the management hinting that something potentially scandalous is going on at Pym's. Under the pseudonym of \"Death Bredon\" (actually his middle names), Wimsey goes to work at Pym's. He takes over Dean's office and learns his trade while investigating the office staff. He discovers a talent for copywriting and promotion, and produces a campaign which will become one of the firm's most successful. He also investigates Dean's social life. Dean, for a short time, socialized with \"the DeMomerie crowd\": the cronies of dissolute socialite Dian de Momerie, most of them heavy cocaine users. He met De Momerie's companion, Major Milligan, who appears to be the cocaine supplier for the group. Milligan is linked to a big cocaine-selling ring which Wimsey's friend and brother-in-law Chief Inspector Parker is investigating. Milligan, hearing that Dean worked at Pym's, spoke to him assuming that Dean was the ring's man at Pym's. Dean was surprised, and Milligan shut up - but Dean guessed that someone else at Pym's was involved. Hence the letter to management. Wimsey plays multiple roles. By day he is Bredon, a distant, impoverished Wimsey cousin who works for a living. Most evenings, he is himself. But on some evenings, \"Bredon\" dresses up as a masked harlequin, and by various wild stunts draws the attention and company of Dian de Momerie - annoying Major Milligan. Junior newspaper reporter Hector Puncheon has a beer in a pub, and discovers later that someone put a bag of cocaine in his coat pocket. He must have blundered into a distribution operation, but there's no further sign of anything at that pub. Apparently the ring holds each week's distribution at a different location. Wimsey continues his probing at Pym's, and learns that one of the senior copywriters, Tallboy, seems to have large amounts of cash. Puncheon recognizes a man who was in the pub the night he was given the cocaine, and follows him. Puncheon gets knocked out, and the man \"accidentally\" falls in front of a moving train. The dead man (Mountjoy) had money but no job or assets, which fits a drug dealer. His effects include a telephone book with the names of many pubs ticked off. One of the marked pubs is the one where Puncheon was given the cocaine. Other clues turn up: a scarab in Dean's desk, a large pebble in the stairwell, a \"catapult\" (slingshot) belonging to office boy Ginger Joe, who is recruited by \"Bredon\" to help in the investigation. Finally Wimsey makes the connection. One of Pym's major clients runs a large newspaper advertisement every Friday morning. The text is approved a few days earlier. The first letter of the advertisement's text indicates the pub to be used that week. Tallboy supplies the letter to the ring as soon as the text is approved. A final clue turns up during a company social outing, in the course of a cricket match between Pym's and Brotherhood's, a soft-drink company and Pym's client. Most of the players are middle-aged and flabby. But Wimsey, provoked by a ball which clips his elbow, shows off the form which made him a first-team star at Eton and Oxford. Tallboy too shows a surprising talent, when he knocks down a wicket with a perfect throw from deep in the field. Wimsey wins the match for Pym's, which is about to expose his cover when the police, led by Parker, arrest \"Bredon\" for the murder of Dian de Momerie. Milligan is dead too - killed in yet another \"accident\" as the ring covers its tracks. But the ring is still operating, and the police want to nab the whole gang at their next distribution. With Mountjoy's phone book, all they need is the letter for the week - which is provided by Ginger Joe. While \"Bredon\" supposedly sits in jail, \"Lord Peter\" is much seen about town for the next few days. The roundup comes off as planned, but the death of Victor Dean remains unsolved. That night, Tallboy comes to Wimsey's flat and confesses. He was sucked into the scheme with a innocent-sounding story and the offer of money he needed. But soon he was trapped. Then Dean found out and blackmailed him. Tallboy shot him in the head with Ginger Joe's catapult on the staircase, so it would look like an accident. Tallboy he cannot escape, and suggests suicide, which would save his family from the shame of his trial and conviction for murder. Wimsey, after looking out of the window, has an alternative: Tallboy must go home, on foot, and never look behind him. Both know that the gang's killers are waiting in ambush.",

McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig Easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. Mikoliunas sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where McAllister raced in to head past Meldrum. Moments later Miller came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar.\nThen McAllister picked up a pass from Stephen Simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past Meldrum's far post. The impressive Mikoliunas twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by Meldrum and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager Richard Gough made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender Goran Stanic, midfielder Gabor Vincze, and striker Ferenc Horvath for Bahoken, Derek Lilley and Mark Wilson. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. Eric Deloumeaux sent Jason Dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to McPake, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and Dair ran on to it and played Easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against McPake but referee Alan Freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser.

He said voters would recognise that Labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the Tories outlined their plans to tackle \"yob culture\" and the Lib Dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. Earlier the Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears.\nIn an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime. He said they should concentrate instead on issues such as the environment, international development and the arms trade, family policy, and the reform of the criminal justice system.\nShadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said: \"We have fought a very positive campaign. I think he will want to look quite carefully at what Jack Straw said about Michael Howard.\"\nIn a speech to the Foreign Policy Centre Mr Straw said of the Tory leader: \"He is clever, fluent and tactical, but he is not wise. \"He lacks strategy and good judgment, and his quick temper and impetuosity too often get the better of him.\" The Foreign Secretary told the BBC: \"I was making the observation that because of Michael Howard's impetuosity you can get lurches of policy.\" Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said: \"People are already really turned off by the kind of campaign the others are fighting and you will see us putting emphasis on some of these huge issues facing the world, particularly the environment.\"\nLabour's focus on the economy as their key message - came on the day a new report was published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, suggesting that household incomes have fallen for the first time in more than a decade. The IFS says the drop partly reflects measures announced in what it called the Chancellor's tax-raising Budget of 2002. The Treasury dismissed the research as \"complete rubbish\". Party election supremo Alan Milburn said the apparent drop in average incomes was because self-employed people had been affected by a \"world downturn\" which hit their profits. Since 1997, the reported average take-home income had \"risen by 20% in real terms\" if you took out the self-employed, Mr Milburn told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Brown also dismissed the figures insisting that the \"typical family\" has been much better off under Labour.",

Upon discovering that Biolystock had extorted $2000.00 from his last Broadway flop, Bloom, simply on a whim, mentions to Biolystock that he could've made a fortune on the flop if he'd only gotten more money from the old ladies. Needless to say, this revelation gets Max's mind working---get the old ladies to invest $1,000,000 on what Biolystock knows will be a surefire flop, then run off with the excess cash! Max convinces the gullible Leo to join him on the scheme, and off the two men go, on a crusade to produce the biggest disaster Broadway has ever seen. They come across a god-awful work written by a former Nazi (Kenneth Mars) called \"Springtime For Hitler,\" and decide to produce it. If it's a flop, Max & Leo will become rich. But if it's a hit, they'll go to jail....<br/><br/>If you're one of the infinite many who've been unable to secure any of those scorching-hot tickets to Mel Brooks' current Broadway phenomenon, \"The Producers,\" there's always this, the original 1968 movie version to watch & enjoy. This Oscar-winner for Best Screenplay is a comedy classic, and easily Mel Brooks' masterpiece, a brilliantly funny film that hasn't aged a bit. Zero Mostel & Gene Wilder are hilarious & perfectly cast as the con-artist producers, with terrific chemistry between them (just their opening scene together, including the great bits about Leo's blue blanket, and Leo terrified of being jumped on by Max, is already one of the great filmed moments of comic acting). Kudos all around to the rest of the cast, too: Kenneth Mars as the deranged Nazi playwright of \"Springtime For Hitler,\" Christopher Hewett as the no-talent gay director who only makes \"Springtime\" even more misguided than it already is, Dick Shawn in an outrageous performance as L.S.D., the hippie ham who lands the coveted role of Hitler (his audition song, \"Love Power,\" is a major highlight), and the gorgeous Lee Meredith as Ulla, Max & Leo's dimwitted secretary. And then there's the \"Springtime For Hitler\" production number itself---yes, it's everything you've ever heard about it, a wonderfully hysterical \"you gotta see it to believe it\" moment in film comedy.<br/><br/>Mel Brooks' direction is spot on, and his hysterical screen writing here has never been better (though his co-writing with Gene Wilder on \"Young Frankenstein\" comes close). His Oscar win for the screenplay was very well deserved, indeed. \"The Producers\" is a timeless comedy classic, and the defining moment of Mel Brooks' long illustrious film career.",

Coupling strength is controlled by thermal\ntuning of one cavity enabling active control of the resonant\nfrequency-matching. In a fabricated silicon microresonator, we show an 8 dB\nenhancement of seeded FWM efficiency over the non-compensated state.

And secondly, they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites. \"The result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites, causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the Gypsies and travellers. \"That is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites, as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment.\" Under the new regulations, expected to be in force in the spring, officials will be able to serve \"temporary stop notices\" aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban. Many MPs with rural constituencies, particularly in eastern England, have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers, saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments.\nAndrew Ryder, of the Traveller Law Reform Coalition, said: \"We welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for Gypsies and travellers, so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored. \"New accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers, as they often do. \"Living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals, legal action and eviction is no one's idea of fun.\" In their November report, MPs from the committee scrutinising the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for housing, said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. Numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities, said the MPs. In turn, the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents. Two of the most controversial traveller sites - Cottenham in Cambridgeshire and Minety in Wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.",
        "direct_prompt": "Local authorities in England have been told they must identify suitable sites for Gypsies and Travellers to live on, as current provision is inadequate.\n\nThe Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said councils that failed to provide enough authorised sites risked legal challenges over unauthorised encampments.\n\nMr Javid warned that unless action was taken, tensions between settled communities and travellers would continue.\n\nHe announced plans to simplify planning rules so it will be easier for local authority to allocate land for traveller sites.\n\nCampaigners welcomed the move but urged ministers to do more to ensure adequate funding for site infrastructure.",

Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series).

It said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced. He said: \"We are working across government, especially with our colleagues at Defra, to create cleaner, safer and greener communities, while protecting and enhancing the environment.\"\nThe report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues, including water, even though supplies in parts of the South East are already too low. Regulations designed to ensure energy-efficient buildings are too lax, and builders routinely flout them anyway, it said.\nFinancing for improving transport was around one-twentieth of what would be required. The report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially John Prescott's department, BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said. Chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee Peter Ainsworth MP, said: \"The government's housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined-up policy is crucial. \"I accept the need to improve housing supply but, as things stand, the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers, with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser.\" Points raised in the report included:\n - No proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence. \n - The government should recognise shortcomings of the Treasury's Barker Review, which said 140,000 new homes a year were needed in Britain. \n - The government should consider a \"national spatial framework\" for England such as those already in place in Scotland and Wales. \n - The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities. \n - Measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes. \n - The government should make clear how it intends to measure its success at creating sustainable communities. \n \nConservative local government spokeswoman Caroline Spelman said: \"There is now growing evidence that John Prescott's buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable, leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural England.\"",

The proposed measures were met with outrage during a parliamentary debate on Wednesday, as members of parliament expressed concern over the lack of affordable homes and support for vulnerable individuals. \n\nAccording to critics, the proposals do little to tackle the root causes of Britain's housing crisis and instead prioritise large-scale development projects that benefit property developers at the expense of ordinary citizens. One MP pointed out that many families are struggling to make ends meet in expensive rental markets, while others are forced to live in temporary accommodation or on the streets. \n\nThe opposition party has called for urgent action to be taken to address the housing shortage, including investing in social housing and providing greater support for first-time buyers. However, the government has remained firm in its commitment to reducing regulation and increasing homebuilding rates, arguing that this will ultimately lead to more affordable housing options for people across the country. \n\nDespite the criticism from MPs, the government remains determined to push ahead with its current strategy, citing recent increases in home building activity as evidence of progress. However, opponents argue that these figures mask the underlying issues facing those who cannot access decent, affordable housing, and call for a reevaluation of the government's approach.",

The one thing I've noticed is that I have some new \"incontinence.\" I use the quotes because it's not really incontinence, it's not stool. Rather, it's the nifedipine ointment that simply comes out as the day goes on. I gently put the ointment on and use my finger super, super gently to dilate. I previously never had the ointment come out prior to dilating. It's not pus, it's not stool, it's nothing concerning, it's just the ointment. It's not even an issue because it doesn't even get to the underwear or anything, it's hardly noticeable, I only notice it because I am extremely vigilant about fissures obviously. Has anyone else experienced this a bit? Could this be a good sign, that the sphincter is maybe a tiny bit less tight?",

The SIAM model is very important, at present it is also used for\nsystems with quantum impurities, e.g. semiconductor quantum dots and molecular\ntransistors. Its main application is in the scheme of dynamical mean field\ntheory (DMFT) describing strong correlation electron systems. To solve the SIAM\nproblem we use the equation of motion (EOM) Green function approach. In this\nreport we present the novel EOM approximation in which we differentiate the\nGreen function over both time variables. This differs from the commonly used\nEOM solution by Appelbaum, Penn and Lacroix where the authors take time\nderivative only over primary time variable. After extending calculations to\nhigher order Green functions we find the new approximate dynamical solution of\nSIAM. The results are compared with the solutions to the SIAM problem at\nintermediate Coulomb repulsion U such as the Modified Iterative Perturbation\nTheory. Our approach is suitable for describing quantum dots.\n",

The EOM method allows us to obtain an exact solution in terms of auxiliary Green's functions and self energies that fully account for all orders of perturbation theory. By analyzing these quantities we can gain insights into various physical properties such as local magnetization, specific heat coefficient, and conductance. Our results demonstrate good agreement with known numerical renormalization group data confirming the accuracy and efficiency of this novel technique.

While attending the bash at which she is to be voted into the \"Crims\" clique, she is followed by someone who appears to be a \"Special\", a member of Special Circumstances. Tally can only remember her adventures as an Ugly in brief, disconnected bits —because, there are lesions on all the pretties brains. She is surprised to discover that the person stalking her is Croy, an old friend of hers from the Smoke. He has something for her, he tells her, but she must search for it later. She agrees, bemused by his repellent ugliness, including his big pores and tangled hair – all the imperfections that the surgery to become a Pretty transforms into beauty. Tally returns to her care-free life as a pretty. Her peace is disrupted when Zane, who is the leader of the Crims, asks her about David, whom she loved while she lived in the Smoke. Zane had once known Croy and had been determined to escape to the Smoke before his surgery. He regrets that he didn't go into the wilderness then. Zane is eager to accompany Tally in finding the object Croy has hidden for her. They face strenuous, dangerous physical challenges in order to locate the item, which is accompanied by a letter from Tally to herself, written before she went under the knife. The letter explained to her future self why she had become a Pretty – to take a brain lesion pill. Zane and Tally learn that the Pretties' brains are altered during their surgery. After taking the pills, their main goal is to be bubbly. \"Bubbly\" is the word Pretties use for being themselves and knowing who they really are. They try to help all the Crims stay bubbly. They do things to make the Crims bubbly, such as crashing a skating rink. When Shay, who, after becoming bubbly, remembered how Tally betrayed her, questions why Tally is bubblier than the rest of the clique, Tally told Shay about the pills. This makes Shay furious because she wanted Tally to share the pills with her. Shay forms a new clique known as the Cutters, who cut themselves to stay bubbly. Knowing that Special Circumstances will come after her any minute, Tally decides that she must go to the New Smoke. Meanwhile Zane is suffering extreme headaches and finding it hard to do everyday tasks. Thinking that this has something to do with the pills, they go to the New Smoke in a hot air balloon, taking the risk of dropping more than 500 feet in the air. Peris decides in the balloon that he does not want to go to the New Smoke. He stalls Tally, and instead of falling to the river, she falls into a reservation with rather primitive people who seem to be very violent. She is considered a god there because of her beauty. There she meets Andrew Simpson Smith, who is the only one who speaks her language. When she escapes the reservation, she goes to the Rusty ruins. When she calls, she sees someone coming down on a hover board and is shocked to find that it is David who has come to take her to the New Smoke. When she arrives, Maddy tells her that the pills she and Zane took separately were meant to be taken together by one person. The nanos that were supposed to eat away the lesions, but they ate more of Zane’s brain tissue because they needed the pill that Tally took to stop them. They soon discover that, when Zane went to the hospital for his headaches, a tracker chip was put in his tooth that sent a message to the Specials. Tally decides to stay with Zane instead of escaping with David. David is confused and believes that she only loves Zane because he is a Pretty. So he tells her she's only staying with him because he's pretty. To make David leave and not get caught himself, Tally tells him to \"get his ugly face out of here\", hurting him. It had the desired result and he flees. She stays with Zane which leads to her getting caught by the Specials. When she is at the Specials office she discovers Shay has been turned into a Special. The book ends with Shay saying 'face it Tally, you're special' which is showing that Shay is either going to make her special or she is going to torture her. tHIS IS THE STUPIDEST BOOK EVER LIKE REALLY DON'T EVEN READ IT",

As she becomes more involved with the rebellion, she realizes that her own identity as well as the fate of all Uglies are intertwined in their struggle against the oppressive regime.

        "human_text": "Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk has said he wants to \"change the face of British politics\" as he launched his new party.\nMr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party,said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration. He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for \"truth\" - would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he was glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.\nMr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. And he announced the party would be holding a leadership election. On Thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader. UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.\nMr Kilroy-Silk announced his decision to quit UKIP at a public meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire last week. It came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. \"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said. \"I will be standing at the next general election. I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. \"And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.\"\nMr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would \"deliver better\" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\nThis is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.\nThank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!\nIt is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk. It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.\nUKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.\nIf he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.\nSo UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!\nInteresting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!\nEvery opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come!\nWell if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It's all flash and no real policy here\nLet's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.\nVeritas? The name will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?",
        "direct_prompt": "In an unexpected move, former Conservative MP Kilroy announced today that he is launching a new political party called Veritas. In his speech at the launch event in London, Kilroy claimed that the current political system is broken and that his new party will bring about real change by focusing on issues that matter to ordinary people.\n\n\"We are tired of politicians who only care about themselves and their own interests,\" said Kilroy. \"The time has come for us to take our future into our own hands and build a better Britain together.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Veritas will focus on key policy areas such as education, healthcare, and housing, with a particular emphasis on addressing inequality and poverty within society. The party has also pledged to increase transparency and accountability in government, with a commitment to regular public consultations and referendums on important issues.\n\nWhile some have criticized Kilroy's decision to leave the Conservatives and start a new party, others have welcomed the fresh approach that Veritas promises to bring to British politics. \"I'm excited to see what this new party can achieve,\" said one supporter at the launch event. \"It's time for something different, and I believe Kilroy and Veritas can deliver that.\"\n\nAs speculation mounts over potential candidates and policies, it remains to be seen whether Veritas will make a significant impact on the UK's crowded political landscape. However, with growing disillusionment among voters towards traditional parties and their leaders, there is certainly plenty of room for a new player to emerge and challenge the status quo.",

        "human_text": "When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing \"The Shining\" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And \"funny\" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highly recommended. - Paul",

With stunning cinematography by John Alcott and a score by György Ligeti that heightens the tension at every turn, this film remains one of the most chilling horror classics ever made.\"",

Suits and sport coats are the most common garments made-to-measure. The fit of a made-to-measure garment is expected to be superior to that of a ready-to-wear garment because  made-to-measure garments are constructed to fit each customer individually based on a few body measurements to customize the pre-existing pattern. \nMade-to-measure garments always involve some form of standardization in the pattern and manufacturing, whereas bespoke tailoring is  entirely made from scratch based on a customer's specifications with far more attention to minute fit details and using multiple fittings during the construction process. \nAll else being equal, a made-to-measure garment will be more expensive than a ready-to-wear garment but cheaper than a bespoke one. \"Custom made\" most often refers to MTM. Overview \nTo order a made-to-measure garment, the customer's measurements are first taken by a made-to-measure retailer. Then a base pattern is selected that most closely corresponds with the customer’s measurements. This base pattern is altered to match the customer’s measurements. The garment is constructed from this altered pattern.",
        "direct_prompt": "Made-to-measure refers to clothing, footwear or other items that are custom made for an individual based on their specific measurements and preferences. This process allows for a more personalized fit compared to off-the-rack options which are mass produced with standard sizing. Made-to-measure garments often require multiple fittings in order to ensure proper fitting and adjustments can be made as needed. \n\nThe term'made-to-measure' is sometimes used interchangeably with bespoke, however there is a difference between the two terms. Bespoke implies that the garment has been designed specifically for the customer from scratch whereas made-to-measure involves selecting from existing patterns and making alterations to achieve a customized fit. Made-to-measure tends to be less expensive than fully bespoke pieces since it relies on preexisting templates rather than starting entirely from scratch.\n\nIn recent years, made-to-measure services have become increasingly popular due to advancements in technology allowing for easier online ordering processes while still providing individualized fits through virtual consultations and at-home measurement appointments. Additionally, many high end fashion brands now offer made-to-measure services catering to discerning clients seeking luxury tailored goods. Overall, made-to-measure provides customers with a unique opportunity to own tailor-made articles that perfectly conform to their bodies resulting in increased comfort, style and confidence.",

        "human_text": "Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.<br/><br/>That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.<br/><br/>So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.<br/><br/>So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.",

Scanning electron microscopy images show smooth surfaces without any defects or dislocations within each layer, while transmission electron micrographs indicate an interfacial roughness at the interface between NiO and MgO due to lattice mismatch.

Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. The firm had been overstating its accounts by $11bn (£8.5bn). Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances.\nIn the New York court on Wednesday, Mr Ebbers' lawyer Reid Weingarten asked Mr Sullivan: \"If you believe something is in your interest, you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it, isn't that right?\"\n\"On that date, yes. I was lying,\" replied Mr Sullivan. Mr Weingarten has suggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something Mr Sullivan denies. Mr Sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow WorldCom board member Bert Roberts that Mr Ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at WorldCom. The trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week.\nUnder 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, Mr Sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned Mr Ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations. Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to stop the fraud. Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom's problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. Prosecutors allege that the company's top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.",
        "direct_prompt": "The former WorldCom director, Bernard Ebbers, has admitted to committing fraud and making false statements to investors during his time at the telecommunications company. Ebbers was charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, and filing false reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He faces up to 45 years in prison if found guilty on all counts.\n\nEbbers' admission comes after months of investigation into one of the largest accounting scandals in US history. In 2002, WorldCom revealed that it had inflated its earnings by $3.8 billion over several years, leading to the resignation of Ebbers and other top executives. The scandal also led to the collapse of the company and resulted in thousands of job losses.\n\nIn his plea agreement, Ebbers acknowledged that he knew about the fraudulent practices and did nothing to stop them. He also admitted to falsely telling investors that WorldCom's financial performance was strong when it was not.\n\n\"I deeply regret my actions,\" said Ebbers in court. \"I let down my colleagues, our shareholders, and most importantly, I betrayed the trust of those who relied on us.\"\n\nEbbers is the highest-ranking executive to be charged in the case so far. Other former WorldCom officials have already pleaded guilty and are serving jail time. The SEC has also filed lawsuits against auditing firm Arthur Andersen and others involved in the scandal.\n\nThe trial for Bernie Ebbers is scheduled to begin next year.",

However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",

According to preliminary results released late Friday night, more than 2 million people voted against continued membership in the bloc - representing nearly 60% of those who cast their ballots.\n\nThe vote marks a major turning point for Britain's relationship with Europe, which has been strained since the country first joined the then-Common Market over four decades ago. While proponents of remaining within the EU argued that withdrawal would harm economic growth and national security, opponents maintained that Brussels had become too powerful and was eroding British sovereignty.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron, who championed the Remain campaign but announced his resignation earlier this week, acknowledged defeat in a statement early Saturday morning. \"The British people have made a decision to take a different path,\" he said. \"We respect their decision.\"\n\nHowever, many are questioning what this means for the future of the UK as it navigates uncharted waters outside the world's largest trading block. The pound sterling took a nosedive on global currency markets following the announcement, while leaders from around the continent expressed concern about the potential fallout.\n\nAs Britons grapple with the implications of Thursday's vote, analysts say there will likely be years of negotiations ahead before any formal exit can occur. In the meantime, questions remain about how this seismic shift in public opinion will affect everything from trade agreements to immigration policy. One thing is certain: history will look back on June 23rd, 2016 as the day when the UK began its journey away from half a century of integration with its continental neighbors.",

Cook the shallots for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently. Toss the chicken livers into the pan, stir to combine and cook for 2 minutes. Toss in the mushrooms, stir to combine and season with salt. Cook the mushrooms until they are soft and wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushroom mixture is almost dry. Remove from the heat and let cool. Transfer the cooled mushroom mixture to a medium bowl, add the goat cheese and chives and mix until it is a homogeneous mixture. Put the mushroom mixture in a disposable piping bag and reserve. Using a paring knife or boning knife, make an incision in the thick end of each chicken breast. Insert the knife all the way into the chicken breast and slide it back and forth to create a pocket. Try not to poke the knife through the top or bottom of the chicken. Squeeze the mushroom filling into each chicken breast. In 3 separate wide, shallow containers, set up a standard breading procedure: one container of flour, one with the beaten egg mixture and one with the panko. Season the chicken breasts with salt. Using one hand for wet things and one hand for dry things, dredge each chicken breast in the flour. Dip in the egg wash and then pack panko onto each chicken breast. Lay the chicken breasts on a sheet tray and let them rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Set up a tray lined with paper towels. Take the chicken breasts out of the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Work in batches if all the chicken breasts do not fit in the pan at the same time. Cook the chicken until well browned on both sides, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove the browned chicken and blot it on the paper towels; season with salt immediately. Repeat with the remaining chicken. When all the chicken has been browned and blotted, place the chicken breasts on a wire rack set over a sheet tray and continue to cook for 10 to 15 minutes more in the oven. For the sauce: Meanwhile, ditch the fat from the pan and add the wine. Reduce the wine by half. Add half the chicken stock and reduce that by half. Add the remaining chicken stock and reduce that by half also (this will take a little time so be patient). Taste the reduced stock and season with salt if needed. Remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the butter. Plate the chicken and spoon the pan sauce over the chicken.",

As you may recall, last year, Kelly Loeffler ran a campaign ad in which she claimed to be \"more conservative then Attila the Hun.\" This confused me, as I'd never heard anything about Attila being particularly conservative; I also just read a Donald Trump quote from the 2000 election cycle, in which he said, \"I'm on the conservative side, but Buchanan is Attila the Hun.\" Hearing two comparisons of conservatives to Attila the Hun has just left me confused, so I came here to ask anyone who can answer: was Attila the Hun especially conservative? Enough so to warrant these hyperbolic comparisons?",
        "direct_prompt": "Attila the Hun is often associated with being an aggressive and violent leader, but did you know that he may have also been conservative in his political beliefs? While there is no direct evidence to support this claim, some historians speculate that Attila may have believed in preserving traditional values and maintaining social order, which are common characteristics of conservatism. It's interesting to consider how historical figures might have held different ideologies than what we typically associate them with.",

Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",

With a catchy soundtrack and plenty of pop culture references, this film is perfect for fans of comedy and sci-fi alike.\"",

However, Sinclair effectively owns WYDO as the majority of Cunningham's stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The two stations share studios on Glenburnie Drive in New Bern and transmitter facilities north of Trenton along NC 41. There is no separate website for WYDO; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WCTI-TV. The station's main signal was originally WFXI (virtual and VHF digital channel 8), licensed to Morehead City. WFXI's signal covered the eastern portion of the market, while WYDO served as a full satellite for the western portion. On September 6, 2017, WFXI was shut down as a result of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s spectrum auction, leaving WYDO as the sole Fox affiliate for the region.

First we generalize, in a novel way,\nmost of the known non-vanishing results for the derivatives of the Riemann zeta\nfunction by establishing the existence of an infinite sequence of regions in\nthe right half-plane where these derivatives cannot have any zeros; and then,\nin the rare regions of the complex plane that do contain zeros of the k-th\nderivative of the zeta function, we describe a unexpected phenomenon, which\nimplies great regularities in their zero distributions. In particular, we prove\nsharp estimates for the number of zeros in each of these new critical strips,\nand we explain how they converge, in a very precise, periodic fashion, to their\ncentral, critical lines, as k increases. This not only shows that the zeros are\nnot randomly scattered to the right of the line Re(s)=1, but that, in many\nrespects, their two-dimensional distribution eventually becomes much simpler\nand more predictable than the one-dimensional behavior of the zeros of the zeta\nfunction on the line Re(s)=1/2.\n",

The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market. However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (£17.7 billion). The UK CD albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold. On average every Briton buys 3.2 CDs per person per year.\nAround 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases. Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the UK. \"A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans' demand for great music,\" said BPI chairman Peter Jameson. The best-selling album globally was Usher's Confessions - one of eight albums to sell more than five million copies in 2004.\nThe growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US. The total number of tracks downloaded last year were up more than tenfold on 2003. Digital sales in the US in the first two months of 2005 are already more than double that of the same period in 2004.\nHowever, some markets in Continental Europe and Asia - notably Sweden, Finland, France, Spain and South Korea - have been drastically hit by internet piracy. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands also saw a decline. \"On the positive side digital sales are booming,\" said John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI). \"However, commercial piracy and illegal file-sharing are continuing to depress our markets. \"The priority in the coming year is to step up the advance of legitimate digital sales and sustain our anti-piracy efforts.\" \"The main choice today's music fan now has to make is whether to get music legally or illegally,\" added Mr Jameson.",

The US came second in the list, followed by Japan and Germany. The rise of streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music has contributed to the growth of the global music industry, which generated $19.1bn in revenue last year. IFPI chief executive Frances Moore said: \"It is fantastic that fans across the globe continue to support artists both old and new.\" However, she added that the coronavirus pandemic was having a significant impact on the industry, with concerts and tours being cancelled or postponed around the world.",

        "human_text": "Internet TV has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now.\nBut any early attempts to do it - the UK's Home Choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network. Now that broadband networks are bedding down, and it is becoming essential for millions, the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line. In the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls, they are keen to be the top IPTV dogs. Software giant Microsoft thinks IPTV - Internet Protocol TV - is the future of television, and it sits neatly with its vision of the \"connected entertainment experience\". \"Telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time,\" Ed Graczyk, director of marketing for Microsoft IPTV, told the BBC News website. \"The challenge has been the broadband network, and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution. \"Compression technology was not efficient enough, the net was not good enough. A lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality.\"\nLast year, he said, was all about deal making and partnering up; shaping the \"IPTV ecosystem\". This year, those deals will start to play out and more services will come online. \"2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in South America, and other parts of Asia, it will expand,\" he added. What telcos really want to do is to send the \"triple-play\" of video, voice, and data down one single line, be it cable or DSL (Digital Subscriber Line). Some are talking about \"quadruple play\", too, with mobile services added into the mix. It is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. According to technology analysts, TDG Research, there will be 20 million subscribers to IPTV services in under six years.\nKey to the appeal of sending TV programmes down the same line as the web data, whenever a viewer wants it, is that it uses the same technology as the internet. It means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the \"broadcaster\". This allows for more DVD-like interactivity, limitless storage and broadcast space, bespoke channel \"playlists\", and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer's fingertips. It potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller, niche or localised audiences, sending films to Bollywood fans for instance, as well as individual devices.\nOperators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer, bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver. Perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking. Currently, there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite, cable or Freeview. With IPTV, the speed is 15 milliseconds. \"That gets rounds of applause,\" according to Mr Graczyk. Microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about IPTV some time ago. \"We believe this will be the way all TV is delivered in the future - but that is several years away,\" said Mr Graczyk. \"As with music, TV has moved to digital formats. \"The things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the TV, to the mobile, to the gaming console and so on.\" The company intends its Microsoft's IPTV Edition software, an end-to-end management and delivery platform, to let telcos to do exactly that, seamlessly. It has netted seven major telcos as customers, representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers. Its deal with US telco SBC was the largest TV software deal to date, said Mr Graczyk.\nIPTV is about more than telcos, though. There are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net's power. Jeremy Allaire, chief of Brightcove, told the BBC News website that it would be a flavour of IPTV that was about harnessing the web as a \"channel\".\n\"It is not just niches, but about exploiting content not usually viewed,\" he said. \"We are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content, and who often see unencumbered distribution. \"For them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive,\" he said. This type of IPTV service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives, for instance. What is a clear sign that IPTV has a future is that Microsoft is not the only player in the field. There are a lot of other \"middleware\" players providing similar management services as Microsoft, like Myrio and C-Cor. But it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful.",
        "direct_prompt": "LONDON - The way we watch television could be about to change dramatically, with experts predicting that within the next decade our phones will become the primary means of accessing TV content.\n\nAccording to industry insiders, advances in mobile technology mean that it is now possible to transmit high-quality video over 4G and 5G networks, making it easier than ever before to access live TV shows, films and sports events on the go.\n\n\"We're already seeing an increase in people using their smartphones to stream TV content,\" said James Martin, CEO of leading media company Sky. \"In fact, last year alone, we saw a 60% rise in customers watching Sky on their mobiles.\"\n\nBut while many are excited at the prospect of being able to watch whatever they want, wherever they are, there are concerns that this shift towards mobile viewing could have significant implications for traditional broadcasters and producers.\n\n\"The challenge for us going forward is how do we adapt to this new landscape?\" said Charlotte Moore, Controller of BBC One. \"How do we make sure that we continue to commission great programmes that people want to watch? And how do we ensure that public service broadcasting remains relevant in this increasingly digital age?\"\n\nDespite these challenges, however, most agree that the future of TV lies firmly in the hands of our smartphones.\n\n\"It's an exciting time for the industry,\" said Martin. \"Mobile technology has opened up so many possibilities for how we consume media, and I believe that in the coming years we'll see even more innovation in this space.\"",

I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song.

When Tara moves to Ohio, the girls continue their friendship through letters back and forth to each other. They have to do this by writing, because Elizabeth's father does not like Tara, and Tara's parents think it is expensive to talk on the phone. The letters detail the changes in their lives – Tara must cope with moving, making new friends and dealing with her mother's pregnancy, while Elizabeth's family begins to fall apart. Tara makes another best friend in Ohio, whose name is Hannah. Tara calls her Pal Palindrome because her name is the same spelled backwards as forwards. It becomes her new nickname and everyone calls her \"Pal\". Tara also gets a boyfriend, Alex, who kisses her. Elizabeth's father starts to scare her when he is coming home later than usual, drinking, and going overboard on his credit cards after he loses his job and has no money. Meanwhile Tara is making new friends, joining clubs and getting involved in school activities. When Elizabeth's family has to move to an apartment because of the money problem, her dad decides to leave, and separates from her mother. It is through their alternating letters that readers learn how Tara and Elizabeth grow and change – and how they keep their friendship strong, even if it is long-distance. This book shows how hard a friendship can be when a person can't see her friend, but suggests that for someone who truly cares about something and works hard for it, anything can happen.",

In contrast, the 12 Euro zone countries will put in a \"lacklustre\" performance, generating growth of only 1.8%. The global economy will slow in 2005, the UNECE forecasts, due to widespread weakness in consumer demand.\nIt warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the United States' huge current account deficit which, in turn, might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates.\nUNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005. However, total output across the Euro zone is forecast to fall in 2004 from 1.9% to 1.8%. This is due largely to the faltering German economy, which shrank 0.2% in the last quarter of 2004. On Monday, Germany's BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005.\nSeparately, the Bundesbank warned that Germany's efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented \"huge risks\" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. Publishing its 2005 economic survey, the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent's growth. Smaller nations such as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta would also be among the continent's best performing economies this year, it said. The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.\nConsumer demand will remain fragile in many of Europe's largest countries and economies will be mostly driven by growth in exports. \"In view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation, monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to 'wait and see', the organisation said in its report. Global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 4.25% despite the continued strength of the Chinese and US economies. The UNECE warned that attempts to bring about a controlled reduction in the US current account deficit could cause difficulties. \"The orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the United States and other economies,\" it noted.",

This is particularly noteworthy given that many other established EU economies are still struggling with sluggish recovery from the financial crisis. Germany, for example, grew by just 0.4% during the same period.\n\nThese results highlight the significant potential for growth that exists within the EU, especially when new member states are able to fully integrate into the single market. The challenge now lies in ensuring that this momentum is maintained, through continued investment in infrastructure, education, and innovation.",

        "human_text": "Going into the theater, I was under the impression that this was a silly James Franco and Seth Rogen movie that made fun of The Room, a legendary bad movie. That's not what the Disaster Artist is at all. Instead, it celebrates The Room. It celebrates Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, their passion, and their pursuit of a dream. <br/><br/> Sure, The Disaster Artist comments on how The Room bombed terribly; it had to acknowledge this. It comments on the utter lack of acting talent that Tommy and Greg possessed; it had to acknowledge this too. But it handles these details with such delicacy and care that I never felt that it was putting down the characters. Actually, it seemed that the film admired them. Even when the world told them to quit, they never gave up on themselves or each other. The message is surprisingly inspiring. <br/><br/> The movie becomes something more than mere mockery because of the way it handles the relationship between Tommy and Greg with such care and affection. The two genuinely liked each other and saw each other in ways that no one else did. Greg certainly did not understand all of Tommy's methods and decisions, but he understood Tommy's good intentions. Establishing this buddy connection is crucial later in the movie. <br/><br/>After Tommy writes The Room and they begin filming, Tommy expresses his idiosyncrasies in full force. While the film crew sees him as a confusing weirdo, we know there's something more. Despite his utter incompetence in directing and acting and all aspects of filmmaking, we still root him. And we still root for Greg, ever the supportive friend. Tommy makes absurd and confounding choices that don't make sense to Greg and they don't make sense to anyone else either. Even one of Tommy's explanations was simply \"people do crazy things.\" Still, Greg remains loyal. <br/><br/>With as strange as Wiseau behaves, capturing his eccentricities would clearly prove challenging. Give James Franco credit for capturing Wiseau's weirdness in character without ever devolving into derisive mockery. Franco captures his gait, stiff shoulders, hunched posture, indeterminable and inconsistent accent, and his laugh. Watching The Room and hearing Tommy Wiseau laugh, I thought that it sounded completely fake. I chalked it up to another instance of poor acting. But after seeing Wiseau in interviews, I realized that it was his real laugh. To him, the laugh wasn't poor acting because that's what he thinks a genuine laugh sounds like. <br/><br/> Seeing and hearing Wiseau behaving as himself explains a lot about his behavior in The Room. He's just an interesting and very unusual guy. His acting and the acting of others in his movie is still atrocious, but it shifts from startlingly and confusingly bad to understandably bad. And more importantly, seeing the real Tommy makes his movie all the more fun. <br/><br/> You don't need to see The Room to enjoy The Disaster Artist. Would it help? Sure. Seeing The Room first makes many of the inside jokes made in The Disaster Artist funnier and gives a clearer sense of how confoundingly weird the movie truly is. Words cannot do it justice. To understand, you have to see The Room for yourself. I recommend seeing both.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"I went into 'The Disaster Artist' expecting just another biopic, but boy was I wrong! This film is so much more than your average drama - it's hilarious, heartwarming and even a little bit surreal at times.

If you're a fan of bad movies or just good old fashioned comedy, this one is definitely worth checking out.\"",

This paper\npresents a new image segmentation algorithm called Adaptive Particle Swarm\nOptimization and Fuzzy C-means Clustering Algorithm (APSOF), which is based on\nAdaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Fuzzy C-means clustering.\nExperimental results show that APSOF algorithm has edge over FCM in correctly\nidentifying the optimum cluster centers, there by leading to accurate\nclassification of the image pixels. Hence, APSOF algorithm has superior\nperformance in comparison with classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and\nFuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FCM) for image segmentation.",
        "direct_prompt": "This research presents a novel approach to color image segmentation utilizing adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm in conjunction with fuzzy c-means clustering. The APSO algorithm is employed to optimize the initial positions of particles, which are then used as input parameters for the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid method achieves improved accuracy compared to traditional approaches while also reducing computational complexity. Overall, our proposed technique offers an effective solution for segmenting complex images into their constituent regions based on color information alone.",

Ginny Moorehead, a woman of seemingly loose morals and poor education, has taken the same bus. Hirsh had left Parkman 16 years before when his older brother Frank placed him in a charity boarding school, and is still embittered. Frank has since married well, inherited a jewelry business from the father of his wife Agnes, and made their social status his highest priority. Dave's return threatens this, so Frank makes a fruitless stab at arranging respectability, introducing him to his friend Professor French and his daughter Gwen, a schoolteacher. Dave moves in different circles, however. He befriends Bama Dillert, a gambler who has serendipitously settled in Parkman. Two factors seem to offer Dave hope and redemption: he takes a fatherly interest in his niece, Frank's daughter Dawn, and falls in love with Gwen. Despite his somewhat notorious reputation, Dave is basically a good, honest man, well aware of his own shortcomings. His cynicism is often a mask to hide the pain of rejection. Though Ginny is not his social or intellectual match, he eventually sees the basic good in her and responds to her unconditional love. In the end, Ginny, stalked by her former boyfriend (a Chicago hoodlum), proves unequivocally the depth of her love for Dave by taking a fatal bullet for him. In the novel, however, it is Dave who is the innocent victim.",

        "human_text": "Council tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.\nAuthorities will decide final figures on Thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation, which is currently 1.6%. The finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased. They say much additional government money is for new initiatives. Scottish Finance Minister, Tom McCabe MSP, said: \"Last week in parliament I announced an additional £419m for core expenditure to local government in Scotland. \"That's a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so I think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint.\" Mr McCabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Live programme: \"Here in Scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.\n\"We think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services.\" The councils' umbrella organisation Cosla, which provided BBC Scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services. Mr McCabe has promised them about £8.1bn next year. \"However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services,\" a Cosla spokesman said. Cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services. They say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending. The Conservatives accuse the Scottish Executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax.\nThe Tory finance spokesman, Brian Monteith MSP, said: \"Its a form of disguise... yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs. \"Scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up, what we've seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill.\" There are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced. Linda Knox, Director of the Scottish Local Authority Management Centre at Strathclyde University, said: \"With this current settlement the increase is slowing. At the same time, the burdens on councils are greater than they were. \"The settlement figures don't include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure - in the area of £325m - in efficiency savings across the settlement period.\" Education will be protected from any cuts but Linda Knox says this will mean other services will suffer. She said: \"In practice, that will mean a 4-5% cut for other services. On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms.\"",
        "direct_prompt": "As councils across England and Wales brace themselves for next week's budget announcement, many are already preparing to raise taxes in order to plug funding gaps caused by central government cuts. According to recent reports, more than half of all local authorities plan to increase council tax this year, with some proposing hikes of up to 5%.\n\nIn addition to council tax increases, other measures being considered include cutting services and jobs, as well as increasing parking fees and charging for bin collection. However, critics argue that these moves will only serve to further burden struggling households already grappling with the effects of austerity.\n\nThe Chancellor has been criticized for failing to provide sufficient financial support to local governments, which have seen their budgets slashed by 80% over the past decade. In response, ministers have argued that additional funds have been made available through various channels, including grants and borrowing options.\n\nHowever, experts warn that unless significant changes are made to address the underlying issues, Britain's local governance system is at risk of collapsing under the weight of fiscal pressures. With tensions between Westminster and devolved administrations also running high, it remains to be seen whether any viable solutions can be found before it's too late.",

Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. <br/><br/>At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. <br/><br/>I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. <br/><br/>NOTE: \"Don't waste your time if you have seen the original.\" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.<br/><br/>10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"Max madness! This adrenaline-fueled ride is nonstop action from start to finish, with stunning visuals and jaw-dropping stunts that will leave you breathless.

        "human_text": "Gordon Brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to £120,000 as he put the economy at the heart of Labour's election campaign.\nThe chancellor also unveiled a one-off £200 council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. Mr Brown put 1p a pint on beer, 4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until September. The Tories called it a \"vote now, pay later\" Budget. The Lib Dems branded it a \"sticking plaster\" for the election.\nTory leader Michael Howard predicted the Budget would do nothing to help Labour's \"faltering\" election campaign.\n\"This government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems Britain faces,\" Mr Howard told MPs. \"Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.\" He ended his response with an election challenge to Labour, saying \"bring it on\". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy attacked Mr Brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice. \"How can it be right in Britain today that the poorest 20% pay more in tax, as a proportion of their income, than the richest 20%?\" he asked.\nMr Kennedy criticised Mr Brown for failing to mention the \"ticking bomb\" of council tax revaluation, saying it was \"high time\" the system was replaced by a \"local tax based on the ability to pay\". During his 49 minute speech Mr Brown told MPs he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004.\nHe said his Budget struck a balance \"between tax cuts that are affordable, investments that are essential and stability that is paramount\". He rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. The child tax credit will rise in line with earnings, giving families an extra £5 a week. In contrast, the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from £4,745 to £4,895 next month. Mr Brown told MPs child benefit would rise to a maximum of £63 a week for the first child and £111 for two children. Despite his giveaways, Budget documents show Mr Brown clawed back £265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. He also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago. BBC political editor Andrew Marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. But trust in Mr Brown's economic stewardship would be a central election issue, he said.\nMr Brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the Queen Mother, funded through a special coin to celebrate the Queen's 80th birthday. Other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the Council of Mortgage Lenders to boost low cost home ownership. The level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from £263,000 to £275,000 from April. Mr Brown said he had met his financial \"golden rule\" with a £6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years.\nThe economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters, he said, and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year, with a forecast of 3% to 3.5% in 2005 and 2.5% to 3% in 2006. The first £2bn of value-for-money savings identified in the Gershon Review have been achieved, the chancellor said. Some 12,500 civil servant posts have been axed, and 7,800 relocated out of the south east of England, he added. SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Brown had failed the \"tartan test\" as there were no measures to boost the Scottish economy. Simon Thomas, of Plaid Cymru, called it a budget for Middle England. UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed \"more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want,\" not \"free bus rides\". The Green Party said the Budget was a \"wasted opportunity\" for environmental protection, adding: \"Brown obviously has an eye on the coming election, and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet.\"",
        "direct_prompt": "British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced plans on Monday to target older homeowners and first-time buyers in an effort to boost Britain's flagging housing market. The new measures, which are part of a broader package aimed at stimulating economic growth, include tax breaks for elderly people who downsize their homes and lower VAT rates for new house purchases.\n\nThe plan is expected to benefit millions of Britons, with some experts predicting that it could help stimulate demand in the sluggish property market. However, critics have raised concerns about the potential impact on younger generations who may struggle to get onto the property ladder due to increased competition from older homeowners.\n\nIn addition to the housing proposals, Mr Brown also outlined plans to invest £1 billion ($1.6bn) into infrastructure projects such as roads and schools, creating thousands of jobs across the country. He said that these initiatives were necessary to tackle the current recession and ensure a strong recovery once it ends.",

        "human_text": "There's a lot of anxiety that goes into viewing The Exorcist, \"the scariest movie ever made\", for the very first time. And with that anxiety comes a lot of expectations and preconceived ideas about what The Exorcist *should* be. Especially for someone born after the film. Then on top of that waited years before finally seeing it.<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist, and after exposure to God knows how many horror films, the Exorcist remains my favorite within the genre. And even from a die-hard fan I have to admit, I hate hearing \"scariest movie of all time\" associated with this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, there's no reason to compare fright factor of films, so forget that anyone ever called The Exorcist \"the scariest movie ever made.\" Take any movie  I don't care what movie  and stick a \"greatest/scariest/best\" whatever tag next to it, and you'll have audiences investing in what they *think* it should be instead of letting the film present itself for what it is. And all they see is that it is not what they expected (expectations, I might add, that are shaped by the current gimmicks and trends in Hollywood).<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist because it dared to defy my expectations. This is not a wall-to-wall, credits-to-credits montage of scary imagery inspired by a mere scenario that's supposed to pass as a plot. This isn't a movie about that long dark corridor and something waiting to jump out of the darkness and attack (which is always preceded by a false scare featuring a cat). It's not about that cheap gimmicky scenario of X amount of people isolated from the rest of the world, with a killer/monster/ghost/whatever on the loose.<br/><br/>The Exorcist is a very slow movie that actually features a full blown plot, its characters, and their associated arcs. The original ambition of The Exorcist was to scare the world with imagery and concepts never before seen in cinema. Shocking moments that the audience of 1973 could not believe they would ever see on the silver screen (from a major studio, no less.) After 30 years, the movie isn't so shocking because times have changed, and the success of the Exorcist has guaranteed countless imitation in all forms across all boards. However, the Exorcist is still one of the most ambition horror films ever made, because (are you ready for this?)  the Exorcist dares to tell a story.<br/><br/>Everyone remembers the pea soup, the head spinning, the vulgarities spewed from the demon's mouth, the stairs, the infamous cut (now restored) spider walk. But I adore this movie for the things no one seems to bring up  I love the setup in Iraq where Father Lancaster Merrin detects the signs of his final showdown, and how these abstract scenes on subsequent viewings give the movie a more epic feel. I love the transition from Chris MacNeil to Father Karras walking across campus that's reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. I became absorbed watching Father Karras caring for his aging mother and the close relationship they have, seeing him depressed and sharing a drink with a fellow priest as he discusses his own issues with faith.<br/><br/>And what impresses me most about a movie named the Exorcist is how it seems to reject the possibility of possession and exorcism as its ultimate and final solution. The characters in the movie don't want it to be true, and in fact don't really even know about the possibility of Exorcism, thus they explore and exhaust all other possibilities (both medical and psychological). I smiled with delight (after all the hospital scenes) in that priceless moment when Chris MacNeil asks Karras, \"And how does one go about getting an exorcism?\" which stops father Karras in his tracks as he, a man of the church, looks at her as though she's lost her mind.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie resists the temptation to jump right into the acknowledgment that Regan is possessed continues to build up the epic Good versus Evil, God versus Satan, the exorcist versus the demon, feel. Like the characters, the movie doesn't want it to be true, it doesn't want to go there and embrace that possibility, but we the audience know what must inevitably happen. And it's almost magical how the movie finally acknowledges Regan's only hope. There's no glorious fanfare nor is there boastful ultimatums, instead the movie lamentingly and silently surrenders to it as we watch Lancaster Merrin walking up the sunny garden path, staring down at a newly delivered envelope. He doesn't have to read it. He already knows what it says, as do we.<br/><br/>The imagery then fades to an ominous foggy night as a taxi pulls up to the MacNeil place in Georgetown, then we're treated to the haunting imagery that inspired the cover art. What must be done, must be done. I love how the movie implies that Merrin has faced this very demon before through its imagery, and through the dialogue as Karras explains he's identified at least three manifestations to which Merrin answers, \"No. There is only one.\" I can address more  the acting, the beautiful cinematography, brilliant makeup  but I'll stop to keep from sounding like a raving fan who over hypes every inch of everything. I'll close with these thoughts: I'm not the type of person who will watch the same movie over and over and over. Most movies I see, the specific imagery and specific ideas don't make a deep enough impression to stick with me for more than a few months. I remember the Exorcist, not because I thought it was the \"scariest movie ever made\", rather because of the wonderful craftsmanship, the fact that it dared to tell a story, and it defied my expectations.<br/><br/>When Friday the 13th, the Grudge, Skeleton Key, and Cursed are reduced to vague memories and general ideas, I will still clearly remember the Exorcist.",
        "direct_prompt": "I still get chills thinking about my first time watching The Exorcist. It's one of those movies that truly transcends its genre and becomes something more - a cultural touchstone, a masterclass in horror filmmaking, and just plain great cinema. \n\nFrom William Friedkin's expert direction to the unforgettable performances by Linda Blair and Max von Sydow, every aspect of this film feels meticulously crafted to elicit maximum terror from its audience. And yet, even beyond the scares (which are plentiful), there is so much depth and complexity to explore within the story itself: themes of faith versus doubt, possession as metaphor for mental illness, and humanity's struggle against evil all come together seamlessly under Friedkin's guidance.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that The Exorcist remains one of the most influential films ever made; inspiring countless imitators but never quite being matched in terms of impact or quality. If you haven't seen it already, do yourself a favor and make sure to add this masterpiece to your must-watch list ASAP. You won't be disappointed.",

        "human_text": "A bad bank (also referred to as an asset management company or AMC) is a corporate structure which isolates illiquid and high risk assets (typically non-performing loans) held by a bank or a financial organisation, or perhaps a group of banks or financial organisations. A bank may accumulate a large portfolio of debts or other financial instruments which unexpectedly become at risk of partial or full default. A large volume of non-performing assets usually make it difficult for the bank to raise capital, for example through sales of bonds. In these circumstances, the bank may wish to segregate its \"good\" assets from its \"bad\" assets through the creation of a bad bank. The goal of the segregation is to allow investors to assess the bank's financial health with greater certainty.  A bad bank might be established by one bank or financial institution as part of a strategy to deal with a difficult financial situation, or by a government or some other official institution as part of an official response to financial problems across a number of institutions in the financial sector. In addition to segregating or removing the bad assets from parent banks' balance sheets, a bad bank structure permits specialized management to deal with the problem of bad debts. The approach allows good banks to focus on their core business of lending while the bad bank can specialize in maximizing value from the high risk assets.",
        "direct_prompt": "A bad bank is a financial institution created to manage and contain troubled assets, typically those that are difficult to sell or value. The term often refers to institutions set up during times of economic crisis in order to prevent systemic risk by removing toxic assets from regular banks balance sheets. Bad banks can be public or private entities and their main goal is usually to reduce the amount of non-performing loans (NPLs) on the books of regular banks, thus improving their capital position and ability to lend again. They may also aim to increase transparency around the valuation of these problematic assets and facilitate their sale through various mechanisms such as securitization.[1] \n\nThe creation of bad banks has been proposed as a solution for managing large amounts of distressed debt during periods of financial stress. However, there is no one size fits all approach when it comes to setting up a bad bank since each situation requires specific considerations based on factors like the nature and extent of problem assets, political economy constraints, legal framework etc... Some experts argue that creating a well designedbad bankcan help restore confidence in the banking system while others believe they might not always be effective depending upon how they operate ultimately leading towards achieving desired objectives[2].\n\nOne example of a bad bank was the United States' Office of Financial Stability established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which took over $300 billion worth of troubled assets from banks including mortgage backed securities. Another notable case study would be Ireland's National Asset Management Agency(NAMA),established in 2009 with an objectiveof takingover €74bn (£67;$95bn)worth ofproblematicpropertyloansfrom Irishbanks soas tounwind them graduallyand recovervaluefor taxpayersby sellingthe underlyingassets.[3][4]\n    \nDespite being seen as useful toolkit in resolving asset quality issues faced by commercial lenders globally, critics have argued about potential drawbacks associated with its implementation too.

Swank won Best Actress for Million Dollar Baby while Foxx triumphed for his performance as Ray Charles in the biopic Ray. Sideways was also among the winners, taking the prize for best cast performance. The next major film award ceremony of the season is the Bafta awards, which take place at London's Odeon Leicester Square on 12 February. Many of those nominated for Oscars including DiCaprio, Foxx and Staunton - an Oscar nominee for her performance in Vera Drake - have also been nominated for Baftas.",

But despite the luxurious surroundings and top-notch cuisine, there's no doubt that everyone's eyes will be on the awards themselves. \n\nWith 24 categories up for grabs this year, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor/Actress, tensions are sure to be running high as the winners are announced during the main ceremony on February 24th. And although many nominees have already won big at other pre-Oscars events like the Golden Globes and BAFTAs, there's still plenty at stake when it comes to the coveted gold statuette itself. \n\nSo as the countdown to the Oscars continues, all eyes are on this year's nominees - both on and off the screen.",

        "human_text": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.<br/><br/>This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana \"beginning\" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat \"You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.\" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. <br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
        "direct_prompt": "\" Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of the best movies in the franchise, with great action sequences, thrilling adventure, and heartwarming family themes. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is undeniable, making their on-screen relationship truly memorable. The iconic hat, whip, and fedora make appearances once again, adding to the nostalgia factor that this film brings. Overall, if you're looking for an exciting ride filled with danger, humor, and suspense, then look no further than Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\"",

But Campese told BBC Sport: \"Robinson is living up to England's reputation as whingeing Poms. \"Stop going on about it as who really cares? They're acting like they're the first team to be cheated of a win.\"\nEngland are contemplating a complaint to the International Rugby Board after potential \"tries\" by Cueto in the first half and Lewsey late on were ruled out without recourse to the video referee. But Campese added: \"Scotland could have beaten France in the same way, but do you see them whingeing? \"Basically, things didn't go England's way and, in typical fashion, they make more of it when they believe they've lost unfairly.\"\nEngland are second bottom in the Six Nations table following defeats by Wales, France and Ireland. But although Campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament, he insisted England were \"no longer world class\". \"England are beginning to realise that being world champions doesn't mean you deserve to win every game,\" he said. \"They lost a few key players and suddenly everyone's realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place. \"Added to that, the senior players aren't standing up and they can't do anything when the pressure mounts.\"\nCampese, a veteran of 101 international caps, said full-back Jason Robinson would now be the sole Englishman in his World XV. Robinson has been blamed for poor leadership in the tournament, while his coach has been castigated for appointing a full-back captain. \"I agree that you can't captain from full-back,\" said Campese. \"You need someone in the thick of the action, and it's very hard to give orders from all the way back there. \"Some people are leaders and some aren't. He's not but there's no one who stands out in England's pack - no clear-cut leaders.\" Campese, though, defended coach Andy Robinson, who he believes was the \"only choice\" after Sir Clive Woodward's resignation.\nBut he blamed \"a lack of talent in the England camp\" for making the current coach look poor. England face a potential wooden spoon match against Italy on 12 March. And the ex-Wallaby added: \"If England lost that, they'd be in bloody turmoil. That said, I don't think they will.\" Campese has tipped Wales to win both the Six Nations and Grand Slam come the end of the tournament. \"It's been a surprising tournament,\" he said, \"and maybe Ireland have a little bit more talent overall. \"But playing at home is a major boost. And the possible Grand Slam decider at the Millennium Stadium will be just too much for the Irish.\"",

When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! <br/><br/>I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.<br/><br/>Back to the Future (1985) <br/><br/>From the Academy Award \"- winning team of Steven Spielberg\" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.<br/><br/>At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car \"DeLorean\". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.<br/><br/>After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.<br/><br/>What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.<br/><br/>They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.<br/><br/>More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost \"chewed every scenes\" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs \"The Power of Love,\" and \"Earth Angel\".<br/><br/>The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as \" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! \"",
        "direct_prompt": "\"The ultimate time-traveling adventure that captures the essence of nostalgia and excitement in one incredible package! Back to the Future boasts unforgettable characters, iconic scenes, and a timeless story that continues to thrill audiences decades after its release. The chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd is undeniable, with their banter and interactions bringing levity to the film's more action-packed moments. The special effects hold up remarkably well considering the age of the movie, proving just how strong the storytelling and character development truly are.

The festival, which honours the best TV from around the globe, will take place in Lucerne, Switzerland from 3-8 May.\nLittle Britain, which is now in its second series, faces competition from BBC Two's The Catherine Tate Show and Sacha Baron Cohen's creations Borat and Bruno. In the separate sitcom category, dark comedy Nighty Night - which began life on BBC Three - will do battle with mainstream BBC One show My Family.\nBBC One's Strictly Come Dancing, which saw celebrities compete against each other to become champions of the dancefloor, is among five British nominations in the varirty category. Lenny Henry, who won a Golden Rose for his In Pieces series in 2001, picks up another nomination for his recent BBC show. British television music shows have picked up six nominations, with BBC Three's Flashmob - The Opera up against the UK Music Hall of Fame series, which was screened on Channel 4. British television has performed very well in the arts and specials category, gaining a total of 11 nominations. The BBC leads the way with its programmes on The Sound of Music, Agatha Christie and Rolf On Art - The Big Event - which saw Harris lead an effort to produce a life-size painting in London's Trafalgar Square.\nBritish shows - which picked up a total of 48 nominations - will have to overcome competition from a host of other countries, including the US, Canada, Japan and across Europe. UK nominee TV Diaries, which is shown around the world, is owned by a British company but has yet to be screened in this country. Previous UK winners have included Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, Pop Idol, Channel 4 show Faking It and comedy duo French and Saunders, who became the first winners to receive and honorary Golden Rose.

Life and career \nBorn in Tucson, Arizona, she began performing as a teenager in community and regional musicals, ultimately moving to Washington D.C. with her family when her father Dean Burch entered Republican party politics in the 1964 White House run for the Presidency by Barry Goldwater. She continued working in the D.C. area and eventually entered Carnegie Mellon University, where she stayed until a move to New York in the 70's. Shelly was cast in her first Broadway show six months after her arrival. She played one of Sammy Davis Jr.'s daughters in the revival of Stop the World – I Want to Get Off, which began its run in California and came to Lincoln Center, NY. In 1979, after several cabaret appearances, she snagged the role of Star-To-Be in Annie on Broadway, and also played the role of Lily St. Regis. In 1980, Tommy Tune cast her in his original Broadway production of Nine. She played the role of Claudia and introduced Maury Yeston's \"Unusual Way\". The role earned her kudos, including one from Frank Rich (then the drama critic for The New York Times), in which he called her \"a Modigliani goddess with another strong voice and an almost otherworldly presence\". She also garnered a Drama Desk nomination for the role. She stayed with Nine until she was tapped to originate the role of the devilish Delilah Ralston on ABC-TV's long-running soap opera One Life to Live. She stayed on the show for eight years, and at the same time honed her cabaret skills. In 1989, after having left Llanview (where One Life took place), she created the role of Julie for the Paper Mill Playhouse's production of Show Boat, which subsequently was filmed by PBS for Great Performances.",

        "human_text": " This story is an example of one of the many unjust acts by both the provincial governments and the national Qajar Regime which led to the Constitutional Revolution. In the province of Quchan, the provincial governor, Asaf al-Dawlah, set a flat tax for all of the people, regardless of their income. The poor could not afford to pay this tax, due to a bad harvest, and the only way they could raise the money was to sell their daughters to the elite Turkmen or to nomads. Turkmen also began raiding the village and capturing the women. When the citizens begged for payment postponement, they were shot and killed by provincial government officials. About two hundred and fifty girls had been sold and they became known as “The Daughters of Quchan”. This incident portrays Iranian women as being “objects of traffic” and clearly speaks to the issue of poverty and the social injustice people faced under this government. The people of Quchan went to the central government to protest and ask for help. Finally an investigator was sent to Quchan, who was bribed by the provincial governor, and did not report the inequality to the central government. The citizens went back to the central government again to protest and eventually the issue was resolved. This story was published in newspapers all over Iran and caused a public outcry for social justice and a parliamentary government. Muhammad Husayn Tabataba’i, one of the most prominent philosophers of the time, was particularly irate and argued that the government was not addressing the needs of the people: \"Have you not heard the tale of Quchan where they had a bad harvest last year? Each Quchani Muslim had to pay three dozen kilos of wheat in lieu of taxes. They did not have it and nobody helped them out. Instead of wheat, the local ruler took three hundred Muslim daughters, counted each daughter for three dozen kilos of wheat, and sold them to the Turkmens. Some of the daughters were separated from their mothers while they were asleep, because the poor souls would not consent to be separated. Now tell me in all fairness! Can you imagine a worse oppression? Every place is in ruins.\"(88) It also showed how effective newspapers were at relaying information across the country as many Iranians sympathized for those in Quchan and would join the cause in protesting for a constitutional government. Asaf al-Dawlah and many of his high-ranking officials were put on trial under the new regime in 1906 and there were multiple efforts made to get the girls back from the Turkmens. While some girls were rescued and brought back to their paternal families, the majority of girls were not found. “The Daughters of Quchan” is one of many events which were instrumental to promoting the Constitutional Revolution as the Iranian citizens began to realize that they were tired of living under an oppressive government.",

Stuart Abbott, Jamie Noon, Ollie Smith, Olly Barkley and Henry Paul - who retains his place despite his early substitution against Australia - are also in the mix. Ben Cohen could also be considered after switching from the wing for his club Northampton recently. Prop Phil Vickery and lock Simon Shaw both return to the squad after missing the autumn Tests through injury, while Wasps wing Tom Voyce is recalled. The group also includes Bath flanker Andy Beattie and Leicester hooker George Chuter. \"Beattie has matured greatly as a player these past two seasons,\" Robinson said. Jonny Wilkinson, Tindall and Martin Corry have all been included despite their unavailability for the opening two matches against Wales and France.\nThe revised 56-man elite squad includes Wasps hooker Phil Greening, who replaces the retired Mark Regan, and Sale wing Mark Cueto. Cueto was selected for the November internationals despite not being part of the group, but scored four tries in three England appearances. Leicester scrum-half Harry Ellis has also been promoted from the senior national academy, and will contest the number nine jersey with Dawson and Gloucester's Andy Gomarsall.

Chop up the seitan so that its pretty small and then mix with all of the remaining ingredients except for the butter and the serving options. Let the mixture marinate for 30 minutes to an hour. 2. Melt the butter in a skillet at medium heat (I realize that butter is not vegan, but I thought the mixture needed a little fat and, well, Im not vegan, so why not?). 3. Pour the marinating mixture into the skillet and cook until the seitan is slightly brown dont over cook! 4. Take out of skillet, top with cilantro, cucumber, and put on top of bread/rolls/rice/noodles.

        "human_text": " The book picks up where the previous one left off. A Spackle army marches on New Prentisstown from one direction, and the forces of the Answer from the other direction. Mayor Prentiss has been freed by Todd to help defend the city, whilst Viola is with the Answer and the scout ship, in hopes of acquiring additional aid. The Mayor assembles his army and orders attacks on the Spackle army at the waterfall near the city. The Spackle, however, while outgunned, are thousands in number, and their weaponry has evolved since the first war thirteen years prior. While keeping the bows and arrows, a new weapon that unleashes white 'sticky' fire is mounted on the back of their bullock -like creatures, labelled ‘battlemores’ by the settlers. This, along with another weapon - white sticks that shoot a mixture of organic chemicals - easily beat back the Mayor's first wave. Todd is nearly obliterated by the fire weapon, but uses his Noise in the same way he used it against the Mayor to incapacitate the rider of the battlemore. A second wave of soldiers, this time utilising artillery to cover them, are able to send the Spackle back in retreat. Meanwhile, Viola finds Mistress Coyle with the scout ship, which has landed at the base of the demolished communications tower. Two friends from the settler convoy, Simone and Bradley have been sent to look for Viola, and are shocked at the state she, and the settlement, is in. Mistress Coyle, at first surprised that Viola is alive, quickly recovers, and tries to explain her actions. But Viola silences her and warns Simone and Bradley not to trust the healer. Then, concerned with Todd’s safety, Viola asks Bradley to launch a survey probe to scope out the scene. After seeing the war and Spackle weaponry, and faced with the risk of losing Todd, Viola nearly launches one of the scout ship's point-to-point missiles at the battle. However, the Mayor’s secret artillery is fired first. Bradley and Simone accept Viola's decision that nobody is trustworthy, save for Todd, and send the probe to observe the Spackle encampment, revealing the enormous numbers they have. The narrative then switches to a Spackle in the midst of the Spackles’ camp. The spackle is 1017, called the Return, and exists as a separate entity to the Land, the Spackles. He is the only surviving Burden, and seeks revenge on the Clearing for killing his ‘one’. His viewpoint ends with Bradley's probe being shot down. The next day, Spackle dam off the river far down, blocking the water supply, and attack the Mayor's camp with a bow-launched burning boomerang that is capable of returning after hitting several targets and then being re-launched in a matter of seconds. Coyle attempts to manipulate Viola to launch a missile to save ‘her boy’, but Bradley is heavily against it. Todd, being watched by a new probe, becomes a stationary target when his horse, Angharrad, refuses to move and he refuses to leave her (he cannot do the same thing he did to Manchee). When Viola thinks she sees Todd getting hit by one boomerang, though it was actually the Mayor's horse, she launches the missile, which causes a catastrophic explosion. This kills all the Spackle archers and blocks the way up and down the hillside, separating the two armies. The Mayor then sends the thought ‘I am the circle and the circle is me’ into Todd, softly, though Todd objects and threatens to hurt him. Then he notices that this quietens his Noise, and pushes away the memories of war, and so he finds himself repeating it for comfort and power. Viola arrives at the town square, shaken that she caused a war for Todd. Todd tells her that he would have done the same, but she finds little comfort. She then notices that Todd’s Noise is quieter, and he sees that she is ill, but the two do not elaborate on either conditions. The narrative switches again to the Return, who is arguing with the Sky, the leader of the Spackle, and demands more action and attacks. The Sky refuses to do anything that will not be for the good of the Land, but asks the Return to trust him, and takes his to the Pathway’s End. He reveals ‘the Source’, a human captured before the war began. The Sky offers the Source to the Return if the two armies reach peace. The Return is unsure why such a person would be considered a reward until he recognises the Source as Ben, Todd's adoptive father. Meanwhile, refugees begin to pour in from the outskirts of New Prentisstown - most of the men joining the Mayor's forces in the town square, while most of the women joining Coyle's forces at the landing site. The Spackle begin attacking the town at random, destroying various targets and killing any scout parties the Mayor sends. The white stick weapons are realised to be some sort of ballistic weapon that shoot acid, which vaporizes on leaving the barrel, but keeps cohesion until it hits a target. Eventually, the water store is attacked, and nearly all of the remaining water is lost. During this time, the Mayor loses control over ordering soldiers with his Noise, and Todd hits him and takes over. The Mayor praises him for having such ability, but Todd is preoccupied with the discovery of James’ body (a soldier who feeds the horses, drowned in the water tank flood). He would not have been killed if Todd had not controlled him to go get extra water for Angharrd, and this causes Todd to regret having controlled him for his own desires. Now without water, and the Answer without food, the two parties are forced into a peace talk at the destroyed House of Healing. The Mayor and Todd meet Coyle, Simone, Bradley and Lee, and Todd and Viola quickly disclose the fact that they have brought additional soldiers who are in hiding. However, Todd doesn’t reveal why his Noise is becoming harder to hear, and Viola refuses to acknowledge that the infection from her arm band is starting to seriously affect her. After negotiations, a peace is reached and a transfer of food is made from New Prentisstown to Coyle's camp. Now that the two groups are working together, the Mayor lures Spackle out to fight them, and the Answer provides bombs to destroy the attacking Spackle. Bradley, nicknamed ‘the Humanitarian’, angrily convinces Todd and Viola to stop this. A Spackle is captured by the Mayor, and then sent back to the encampment with two messages. The Mayor sends one of absolute silence, and Todd tells them that they want peace. He hears the Spackle call him ‘the Knife’ before running away. Angry that the Mayor undermined her, Mistress Coyle sends a bomb into the Spackle stronghold. The Spackle respond by sending the same Spackle that was captured, telling them to send two people to meet the Sky on the hill tomorrow morning. Viola and Bradley, who has caught the Noise germ and will thus appear more trustworthy, are sent to talk. The Sky greets them, but one individual - 1017, the survivor of the Mayor's genocide, and the Spackle who had sworn vengeance on Todd when he was saved - recognizes Viola as Todd's ‘one’, and attempts to murder her. However, he stops when he sees the ID band that had been banned onto her wrist, and in his surprise is taken away by the Land. Hesitantly, the peace talks resume. That night, however, the Spackle launch a surprise attack on the Mayor and Todd. But the Mayor, who had read the Sky’s Noise through the messenger, knew of this plan beforehand and had already set up his artillery and soldiers. After killing the attacking Spackle, the Mayor grabs Todd’s comm and tells the Sky that he can read him and that he should forfeit. The Sky, shocked, agrees. The Return, meanwhile, has returned to the Pathway’s End to kill Ben as peace has now been reached. The Sky meets him there, and watches as the Return fails to murder Ben, unable to kill just like Todd. He resents this, but the Sky tells him he will need this knowledge when he becomes the Sky, and then wakes up Ben, ignoring the Return’s confusion at this statement. When Ben wakes, he can speak in the language of the Land. The next day, peace is reached, though negotiations are scheduled to continue. The Mayor strategically announces that they have beaten the Spackle to the hilltop campers, and that a cure for the ID band infection has been found. Mistress Coyle is outraged and convinced that the Mayor planned this, and takes to testing the cure, warning that audience that the Mayor is up to something. Her accusations are met with booing and anger, and she recedes in bitter anger. Soon, testing reveals that the cure uses an aggressive antibiotic mixed with an aloe the Mayor claims he found in Spackle weaponry, which allows the medicine to disperse ten to fifteen times faster. Viola asks Todd to decide if she should take the cure. At the town square, the Mayor teaches Todd how to read by giving his skill of reading through Noise. After reading his mother’s diary, Todd asks the Mayor if the cure is real, and the Mayor simply says it will. Convinced, Todd brings the bandages to Viola the next morning to treat her infection. A little later, Mistress Coyle delivers a speech on her intentions to resign and hand over leadership to the Mayor fully. However, it quickly turns out to be a plot to kill the Mayor using a bomb strapped to her own person. Todd, in an attempt to save Simone who is in front of Mistress Coyle, inadvertently saves the Mayor instead, foiling her plan and revealing that he can control people with his Noise (as he ordered Wilf to jump from his position near Mistress Coyle). The Mayor thanks Todd endlessly but Todd is horrified that he has saved the Mayor subconsciously and not Simone, as proven by the replay on nearby probes. Viola is similarly horrified, unsure of who Todd has become. She tells him that she hates his silence, and they fight, Todd convinced that the Mayor has changed and Viola accusing him of turning into the Mayor. She then tells him that she cannot trust him anymore; that he isn’t him anymore, causing his Noise to flare up in anger, shock and hurt. The Mayor interrupts before more can be said, intent on delivering another speech to show the citizens that he is okay. As the Mayor starts the speech, and asks Todd to be his son, Ben and the Return arrive. Todd, overwhelmed by happiness, launches himself at Ben and leaves the Mayor on stage, ordering people to get out of his way as he runs. The two embrace, and the Mayor is left feeling betrayed and unwanted. Now that Ben can speak the Spackle’s language, he prefers using his Noise to communicate, and, consequently, Todd’s noise opens up around Ben as they talk. After this, Todd asks Viola to leave New Prentisstown with him when the war is over, and declares that he doesn’t care about what will happen to everyone without his supervision. His Noise is audible once more, and he openly thinks about how beautiful Viola is and how he wants to hold her. He hastily apologises, but Viola kisses him, and thinks that it feels like ‘finally’. The present party splits to settle a peace immediately, leaving Todd and the Mayor alone. Angered that Todd no longer cares about him, and wishes to leave him the moment peace is established, the Mayor shoots Ivan and steals the scout ship, kidnapping Todd in the process. Learning how to operate the scout ship by stealing Bradley’s Noise, the mayor launches the missiles at the Spackle, where Bradley, Viola and Ben are still negotiating terms. However, the missiles and 'cluster bombs' later fired does not explode. The Mayor decides to try something different, remembering a trick Bradley’s grandfather had taught his grandson. He remixes the fuel and releases it. The fuel mixture is the same used by Viola's campfire box in 'The Knife of Never Letting Go' when only a few drops blew up the bridge between old Prentisstown and Farbranch. The fire kills many Spackles, including the Sky, and the Return becomes the new Sky. Todd attempts to call Viola, but is cut off by the mayor. However, Todd manages to convey that they are headed for the ocean. The new sky then releases the water as a retort. In this process, the town is swept away, and the army, previously controlled by the mayor, returns to self-control. Humans and the Sky then manages a ceasefire. The Mayor then lands at the ocean. The new Sky decides to attack the settlers, while the Mayor had ordered his remaining captains to attack the Answer and march into the town square to die. However, Lee, using a rifle with Wilf's help, kills Captain Tate and the soldiers join the remaining people. Wilf and Ben manage to dissuade the Sky from the attack, Wilf’s honest and open Noise showing the Sky how to listen to the Land, leaving the Mayor disappointed. Viola and Bradley now ride to the ocean in hopes of aiding Todd. However, Acorn, Viola's horse, dies from exhaustion, and she is forced to ride Angharrad while Bradley is left behind. At the ocean, the Mayor congratulates Todd, then says he will be a fine leader of New World - a world he doesn't want to be a part of, as the mayor is dying, by his 'too much knowledge'. The mayor then fights with Todd, using only their noises, and Todd wins. The mayor then commits suicide by walking into the sea, where the killer fish eats him. The Sky arrives on his battlemore with Ben. He sees Viola and Todd, but mistakes Todd for the Mayor and shoots him in the chest with the acid rifle. Todd’s Noise disappears, and he dies, driving Viola to threaten shooting the Sky back. The Sky, revealing that he shot despite knowing that it might have been Todd, realises how wrong he was to do so, and feels the regret Todd felt when killing a Spackle in book one. Viola stops short of killing him, realising that it would cause never-ending war, and that no one would remember Todd, and everything that he had done, after. She warns the Sky to get out of her sight, and returns to Todd. Ben suddenly asks if she can hear anything, swearing that he can hear Todd’s Noise. The Spackle attempt to cure Todd with their medicine, and house him in the Pathway’s End. The remedies are working, and his Noise returns in burst on and off. The main convoy is about to arrive to a large ceremony, one which Viola will not attend because she will not leave Todd’s side until he wakes up, though she knows that he will be changed, like Ben was. The Sky has promised not to take the cure for the band infection until Todd is cured, in an act of self-discipline, but Viola does not forgive him and will not let him enter to see Todd. Everyday, Viola continues to read Todd's mother's journal to him, hoping that he will hear and come back. The epilogue cycles through Todd's experiences in the coma. He is entering his old memories, at his school, at Farbranch, but also human and Spackle memories from all over New World. He searches for Viola, unsure who she is, who he is. Every now and then, he hears abstracts from his mother’s diary, and Viola, and he begs Viola to keep calling for him. The novel ends with hope that he’ll return, the last lines being \"Keep calling for me Viola-, Cuz here I come\".",

        "human_text": "Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop.\nHip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
        "direct_prompt": "Spanish hip-hop is making waves on an international scale, thanks to web radio platforms that are giving artists a platform to showcase their music and reach audiences beyond Spain's borders. These online stations have played a crucial role in popularizing the genre and bringing it to a wider audience.\n\nOne such artist who has benefited from this exposure is Mala Rodríguez, whose song 'Arte de la Sublevación' became a viral hit after being featured on Radio 3Fem, one of several internet radio stations dedicated to promoting urban music in Spain. The track now boasts millions of views on YouTube and Spotify, cementing Rodriguez's status as one of the country's most prominent rappers.\n\nThe success of these web radios lies in their ability to cater specifically to niche tastes within the musical landscape, providing listeners with content they may struggle to find elsewhere. In doing so, they offer upandcoming talent valuable airtime which can help them gain recognition both domestically and internationally.\n\nAs well as helping launch new careers,web radio also plays apivotalroleinkeepingestablishedartistsrelevantbyexposingthemtoaneverbeforeseenaudience.Forinstance,thesuccessofReggaetonstarBad BunnycanbeattributedinyparttotheairtimethePuertoRicanartistreceivedonRadiosLatinaUSA,anelectronicstationwithafocusoninternationalurbanmusic.Bunny'scollaborationwithLatinostarslikeJ Balvin and Cardi Bhave helped him becomeoneofthemostrecognisablenamesintheglobalpoplandscape.\n\nWhile traditional media outlets still play acrucialroletoday'smusicecosystem,webradioplatformsareprovingthemselvesasvaluablenetworksthatcanchange thenarrativeforthebetter.

Add the pre-cut bacon and hot dog (Spam if available) and cook for another 10 minutes. Follow that with the instant ramen noodles and wait until noodles separate on their own.  3. When noodles have separated, taste the broth of the stew and regulate according to taste preference. This might be too spicy for some so reducing the red pepper paste and flakes or adding extra water will help alleviate this problem.  4. Serve immediately before noodles soften and set at the center of the table where everyone can help themselves, or plate individually into separate bowls. Eat with rice and banchan side dishes.  *Many Koreans will also include some of the spicy sauce packet from the instant noodles (Shin Ramen being the most ideal) that can surprisingly add more depth and flavor to the stew.",
        "direct_prompt": "Ingredients:\n- 1 L sausage, sliced diagonally\n- 2 cups spam, diced\n- 4 oz cheese, shredded\n- 8 oz tofu, cubed\n- 6 cloves garlic, minced\n- 3 green onions, chopped\n- 1 tablespoon gochujang paste\n- 1 teaspoon doenjang paste\n- 5 tablespoons soy sauce\n- 10 ounces ramyeon noodles, crushed\n- 7 cups water\n- 2 tablespoons sesame oil\n- Salt and black pepper, to taste\n\n  1. In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the sausages until brown on both sides. Remove from pan and set aside. \n      2. Add Spam to the same pot and stir fry till lightly golden. Then add in the cheese, stirring constantly so it melts evenly. Once melted, mix in the cooked sausages back into the pot along with the tofu cubes. Stir well making sure everything is combined nicely.   \n \n        3. Next step would be adding all your sauces such as GoChuJang Paste, DoEnJang Paste & Soy Sauce then pour in about half of RamYeon Noodle Soup Base which comes inside each packet you have bought. Mix them together very gently ensuring that soup base doesn't get too much mixed up else we will end having mushy stew instead of nice thick one! After mixing these ingredients properly now its time bring our dish almost close completion by pouring remaining portion leftover noodle broth/soup mixture directly onto center part where meats are placed earlier before cooking process began initially; this helps create rich flavorful gravy throughout entire budaetteok jjige.    \n \n\n \n          4. Finally let's not forget garnishing bit! Finely chop rest Green Onions keeping whites separate than greens they'll give freshness crunchiness while sprinkle little amount toasted seaweed powder adds extra umami kick giving authentic touch Korean cuisine needs sometimes especially when preparing dishes like Budaetteok JJIGAE :) Enjoy Your Meal!!",

While not all were hit with the critics, he has managed to garner a following. The trailer for his latest Here Comes The Boom looked like a mix of the same old fair that he normally delivers, but does it have any chance of working to deliver a funny comedy or will it end up being just another forced goofy addition to his resume.<br/><br/>Here Comes The Boom follows a biology teacher who is determine to save the music program from being cut in their school by becoming a mixed-martial arts fighter. While the premise is a bit out there and some of the scenarios are a bit far-fetched this movie works surprisingly well. There are plenty of laughs here that work on numerous levels, but depending on how big a fan of James you are will determine how funny they are. The real surprise here was the fact that there was so much more here than just a stupid comedy. The story is a typical underdog tale with comedy, but enough heart to keep you rooting for James throughout the whole film. Gone is the usual over the top bumbling funny fat guy, in its place was a cooler everyman that works perfectly for this story. James steps up to really deliver more than he has to date. He shows not only a good range with some different emotions, but is pretty impressive with his ability to carry the fight scenes. It was nice to see that while this was a comedy, they still took the fighting side of it seriously to deliver something not only believable but entertaining and will suck you right into the action. The rest of the cast do a great job of bringing everything together, with the real highlights being Henry Winkler who is a spitting image of the band teacher in the Simpsons and former MMA legend Bas Rutten. Both of these guys never take themselves seriously and deliver some funny memorable and likable characters.<br/><br/>This movie was a real surprise on almost every level. It delivers an almost Rocky like underdog tale with some over the top funny moments to create something completely unexpected. Kevin James really knocked it out of the park here and hope he sticks to these kinds of roles and continues to stretch his acting range.",

The fight scenes were well choreographed and exciting, without resorting to excessive vulgarity or violence. Overall, this film is a great choice if you're looking for something lighthearted and entertaining that also has a message about following your dreams and never giving up.\"",

Thus, it refers to the retreat of a glacier, an ice sheet or frozen surface layer, and the resulting exposure of the Earth's surface. The decline of the cryosphere due to ablation can occur on any scale from global to localized to a particular glacier. After the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 21,000 years ago), the last deglaciation begun, which lasted until the early Holocene. Around much of Earth, deglaciation during the last 100 years has been accelerating as a result of climate change, partly brought on by anthropogenic changes to greenhouse gases. The previous deglaciation took place from approximately 22 ka until 11.5 ka. This occurred when there was an annual mean atmospheric temperature on the earth that increased by roughly 5 °C, which was also accompanied by regional high-latitude warming that exceeded 10 °C. This was also followed by noteworthy deep-sea and tropical-sea warming, of about 1–2 °C (deep-sea) and 2–4 °C (tropical sea). Not only did this warming occur, but the global hydrological budget also experienced noticeable changes and regional precipitation patterns changed. As a result of all of this, the world's main ice sheets, including the ones located in Eurasia, North America and parts of the Antarctic melted. As a consequence, sea levels rose roughly 120 metres. These processes did not occur steadily, and they also did not occur at the same time.",
        "direct_prompt": "Deglaciation refers to the process by which ice sheets and glaciers retreat or melt, resulting in an increase in global sea levels. This phenomenon has occurred multiple times throughout Earth's history, with the most recent deglaciation event taking place approximately 20,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. During this time, large ice sheets covering much of North America, Europe, and parts of Asia began to melt, leading to significant changes in ocean currents, climate patterns, and ecosystems around the world. The rate of modern-day glacial melting is considered to be significantly faster than previous deglaciation events due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, causing concerns about potential impacts on coastal communities and global sea level rise.[1]",

        "human_text": "I was a fan of the \"V for Vendetta\" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.<br/><br/>The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in \"Closer\". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it's too late.<br/><br/>The Wachowski Brothers' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit \"The Matrix\". Unlike \"The Matrix\", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn't show off, and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.<br/><br/>With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another \"Matrix\"-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in \"V\" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. \"V for Vendetta\" is a must-see.<br/><br/>10/10",
        "direct_prompt": "The world has been taken over by a fascist government, and one man wears a mask to fight against their tyranny - V for Vendetta. With stunning visuals that bring his storybook-like rebellion to life, this film is both thrilling and thought provoking. The themes explored are relevant even in today's society, making you question your own beliefs about freedom and justice. Natalie Portman gives a strong performance as Evey Hammond, whose path crosses with V's as she becomes more involved in his mission. Hugo Weaving brings depth and intensity to the role of V, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats wondering what he will do next. Overall, V for Vendetta is a must watch for anyone who values liberty above all else.",

The story begins with Tey taking the train from Scotland to London in order to attend the final week of performances of her renowned play, Richard of Bordeaux, written under the pseudonym Gordon Daviot. On board, she meets a young woman, Elspeth Simmons, the adopted daughter of hatmakers from Berwick-upon-Tweed. The two strike up a friendship on the journey, as the girl is a fan of Tey's work, and is on her way to see the play again. Upon arriving in London, the pair separate, as Elspeth has left her bag on the train. Soon after, the girl is found dead, apparently having been stabbed with a hat pin, a crime which seems to have been carefully planned. Here enters Detective Inspector Archie Penrose, an old acquaintance of Tey's, the best friend of her lover, whom Penrose saw die at the Somme. Clues and circumstance suggest that Tey may have been the intended target, so the narrative follows her and her time at the theatre. There, we are introduced to a world of excitement and intrigue, and more death follows. We meet the leads in the play, Johnny and Lydia; the two are presumably based on the real life leads in the best-selling run, John Gielgud, whose career it, arguably, made, and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies.

        "human_text": "General Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; £1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.\nFiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement. But Fiat's heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. Fiat's shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 GMT to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7% in early trading. \"We now have absolute freedom to design our own future,\" said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.\nAnalysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days. The firm is Italy's largest private employer, and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy. For its part, GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.\n\"We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat,\" said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.\nThe Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright. German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm, but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control. Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a \"put option\" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share. As a result, the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians - and much worse for GM, which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GM's stake to 10%.",
        "direct_prompt": "General Motors has agreed to pay $2 billion to exit a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, according to reports on Monday. The move comes as GM looks to focus on its own operations and avoid being taken over by FCA.\n\nThe agreement includes a payment of $500 million from GM to FCA, as well as the transfer of some manufacturing plants and other assets worth around $1.5 billion. The deal is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks.\n\nSources close to the matter said that GM had been seeking an escape clause in the alliance agreement with FCA for some time, citing concerns about the Italian-American company's financial stability. GM reportedly approached FCA last year with proposals to end the partnership, which was formed in 2019.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with FCA, which allows us to focus on our strategic priorities and create value for our shareholders,\" a spokesperson for GM said in a statement.\n\nFCA declined to comment on the matter, but sources familiar with the situation said the Italian automaker was disappointed with the outcome of negotiations with GM. The two companies had hoped to deepen their alliance despite growing tensions between the US and Italy over trade issues.\n\nThe development comes at a critical moment for both auto giants, as they navigate a rapidly changing industry marked by shifting consumer preferences, rising costs, and intense competition from tech firms like Tesla. Analysts say the breakup of the alliance could lead to further consolidation among global carmakers as they seek to streamline operations and invest in emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving.",

        "human_text": "What's interesting to me is the deeper meaning and symbols of the film. The film is really about two women. Sarah, and her friend, Juno. The film opens with Sarah losing both her husband and child in a horrific wreck. Over the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that the accident was caused because the husband was distracted and upset over an affair he was having with Juno. Sarah is aware, at least subconsciously, of Juno's betrayal and that it lead to the deaths of her husband and child. She is not in a place mentally or emotionally to acknowledge it on a conscious level. When Sarah awakens from the wreck, there is a sequence where she runs from darkness. The darkness symbolizes a call to action. Sarah rejects it by running from it. She isn't ready yet. This is classically what chase dreams are about. The dreamer is being pursued by their subconscious given horrible form. If the dreamer can make a conscious effort to stop running and speak to the scary thing chasing them, that dreamer's unconscious will speak directly to the dreamer. This would be the conscious (dreamer) dropping the ego defense (running) and interacting with the subconscious (chaser) to gain new insight.<br/><br/>A year passes and Juno get all the friends together to go spelunking. She lies and takes them to a cave she has discovered because she wants Sarah and her to be the ones who find the cave complex and name it. In Juno's sick mind, she's trying to perform some type of penance. She doesn't see that she's manipulating her friends to do something incredibly dangerous. Juno is a manipulator who only sees things from her own narcissistic point of view. Other people are only as real as Juno feels about them.<br/><br/>Going underground is dream imagery for going into the subconscious. This could be going into a basement under a bar as in Fight Club or even underwater.<br/><br/>Sarah is returning to the darkness that she ran from earlier. She starts to experience hallucinations (waking dreams) mainly her daughter's laugh. Her subconscious is pulling her back to the event that damaged her psyche (the wreck).<br/><br/>They get trapped and so must go deeper into the cave to find a way out. Thus Sarah is going deeper and deeper into her subconscious. It's not readily apparent but it's when they get to the deepest point of the caves (the deepest level of consciousness) that they actually encounter the cave people. If you watch you'll notice that they stop traveling downward (they may fall or are be pushed downward but the never choose to go down). Thus the cave people are the most base and ancient level of Sarah's mind. They lack all their senses. They have no problem-solving or tool-using skills but they are very strong and aggressive. They are a primal force.<br/><br/>While down with these creatures, several key events happen. The first is that Juno and Sarah's friends began to be picked off. The second is Juno's true character is revealed. She stabs one of her friends (accident) but then leaves rather then helps her (because of shock but on purpose). What's interesting is that as soon as Juno reunites with the main group, she makes a big show about she won't leave without Sarah who is missing. She acts differently when people are around. Character is what you do when others aren't watching. Juno is a person of weak character.<br/><br/>The biggest key event is that Sarah is separated from the group and ends up in the den of the cave dwellers. The heart of this lowest level of her subconscious. It is here that Juno's original betrayal becomes fully known to Sarah's conscious self. The friend that Juno stabbed is bleeding to death and tells Sarah of Juno and her husband. It's at this lowest level that Sarah understands Juno. Juno is the type of woman that would wreck the marriage of a good friend, stab a friend and leave them to die alone, and lead all her friends to certain death because of an ego trip. In short, Juno is a destructive force. Sarah kills her hurt friend to end her suffering. This is the action that Juno refused. Sarah empathized with her friend and refused to leave her in pain to make her escape. Juno did not do this. Juno felt that her feelings and safety were more important than her friend's suffering.<br/><br/>The other event that happens in this room, is that Sarah kills a cave dweller child and observes it's mother grieving over the loss. Sarah has now committed the same sin as Juno. The mother tries to kill Sarah. This is what is missing from Sarah's life. Sarah needs to take vengeance on Juno to become whole.<br/><br/>Sarah eventually meets up with Juno again and they began to make their way out as the last two survivors. After the last big fight against the cave dwellers, Sarah confronts Juno about her lies, manipulations, and betrayals. Then, Sarah stabs Juno in the leg and leaves her for the cave dwellers. This the same action Juno took earlier when she stabbed her friend and left her. What is different is that Sarah makes a conscious choice to kill Juno and takes responsibility for the action where Juno avoids the responsibility of everything she has done.<br/><br/>Then there is a long sequence where Sarah is climbing upward out of the dark to the light. This is symbolic of a return to consciousness and the real world.<br/><br/>This movie has parallels with Hamlet. What is missing from Sarah is what was missing from Hamlet. They both need to take action but because of the horribleness of the action they must take, they have recoiled from it and spend the whole story getting to a point where they come to terms with what they must do to be whole.",

Moloh was known to work with colonial powers to keep power and thwart rebellions; this would later lead to his downfall. The Fulbe Empire \nThe Fuladu kingdom was founded, born of rebellion led by Mussa Moloh’s father, Moloh Eggue, also known as Alfa Moloh, against the Mandinka who formerly ruled the Gambia region.  Those Mandingo rulers who once owned the land now the Fulbe state remained inside the kingdom once belonging to them.  The scape of this empire  in demographical terms was wide and diverse, despite the Fulbes being generally regarded as a homogenous group. Being a diverse group ultimately led to cultural struggles of power leading Alfa Moloh to quarrel with some groups causing these groups to leave the Fulbe state. The core of Alfa’s following was the Fulbe Firdu.  Consisting of roughly 30,000, the Firdu moved north to make permanent settlements in Tomari and Jimana, two of the former Mandingo kingdoms in the Gambia valley. Later, the Fulbe empire would turn into a state directly resulting from the efforts of Alfa’s son, Mussa Moloh.",

He is believed to have been responsible for several high profile attacks against African Union peacekeeping forces and other targets within Somalia. Born on January 1st, 1990, in Merca, southern Somalia, he grew up in Kismayo before moving to Kenya where he became radicalized and joined al-Qaeda affiliated group Al-Shabaab. In 2012, US government offered $3 million reward for information leading to his capture or death. On October 5th 2013 Kenyan security officials announced that they had killed him during a raid in the coastal city of Lamu. His killing marked a significant blow to Al-Shabaab's leadership structure at the time.

        "human_text": "Semantic image segmentation is an important computer vision task that is\ndifficult because it consists of both recognition and segmentation. The task is\noften cast as a structured output problem on an exponentially large\noutput-space, which is typically modeled by a discrete probabilistic model. The\nbest segmentation is found by inferring the Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) solution\nover the output distribution defined by the model. Due to limitations in\noptimization, the model cannot be arbitrarily complex. This leads to a\ntrade-off: devise a more accurate model that incorporates rich high-order\ninteractions between image elements at the cost of inaccurate and possibly\nintractable optimization OR leverage a tractable model which produces less\naccurate MAP solutions but may contain high quality solutions as other modes of\nits output distribution.\n  This thesis investigates the latter and presents a two stage approach to\nsemantic segmentation. In the first stage a tractable segmentation model\noutputs a set of high probability segmentations from the underlying\ndistribution that are not just minor perturbations of each other. Critically\nthe output of this stage is a diverse set of plausible solutions and not just a\nsingle one. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model\nselects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much\nmore complex features than what could be tractably used in the segmentation\nmodel, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than simply\nreturning the MAP solution. The formulation is agnostic to the underlying\nsegmentation model (e.g. CRF, CNN, etc.) and optimization algorithm, which\nmakes it applicable to a wide range of models and inference methods. Evaluation\nof the approach on a number of semantic image segmentation benchmark datasets\nhighlight its superiority over inferring the MAP solution.",

Gamers have been queuing outside shops across the US to get their hands on the gadget, which costs $250 (about £132). The first million sold will come with the Spider-Man 2 film on UMD, Sony's own disc format for the device. The PSP can be linked up with others for multiplayer gaming, via a wireless connection. Sony has touted the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan since its launch there last year.\nBut it faces stiff competition from the Nintendo DS, which sold more than the GameCube in its first few days on release in Europe. It too allows for multiplayer gaming over the air. Nintendo dominates the handheld market, with more than a 90% share of the market in the US alone. The Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget also went on sale in the UK last week. It hopes to take a share of the handheld gaming market too.\n\"The story of the PSP is it's not a gaming device as much as it is a portable entertainment device,\" said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. He told the Reuters news agency that he expected Sony to sell about 10 million PSPs in enough time to rival Apple's iPod. There is no date for the PSP's release in Europe yet. Sony has promised to have a million units ready for its US launch, but there are fears demand may not be met. It also said it expected to ship three million PSPs worldwide by the end of its fiscal year ending 31 March.\nThe machine's European launch was put back \"a few months\" last week in order to make sure enough of the devices were ready for its US launch, as well as satisfying the Japanese market. The PSP has almost as much processing power in it as the PlayStation 2 console. Hundreds of gamers gathered at US shops, some waiting for more than 36 hours, to be the first to get their hands on the gadget. A spokesman for one US shop said it expected the device to sell out on its first day. The 24 games for the mini console include Ape Academy, Formula One, Wipeout Pure and Fired Up. Movie studios, including Lions Gate Entertainment and Disney, have also announced forthcoming film titles that will be made available on the UMD format.",

Their announcement has sparked excitement among fans who have been eagerly awaiting new material from the iconic Southern rap group. \n\nAndre 3000, also known as André Benjamin, recently appeared on Saturday Night Live where he confirmed the reunion during a skit. He said that the band would be performing together again but did not provide any details about future projects or album releases. \n\nOutkast's impact on the music industry cannot be understated. They won six Grammy Awards throughout their career and were inducted into the Atlanta Music Hall of Fame in 2010. Their unique style and innovative approach to hip-hop helped shape the sound of the genre over the past two decades. \n\nFans across social media platforms have expressed their joy at the reunion, with many calling it long overdue. Some speculate that the band may perform at this year's Super Bowl halftime show, which is set to take place in Houston, Texas - the city where Outkast originated. However, no official announcements have been made regarding upcoming performances or albums. \n\nDespite the lack of concrete information, one thing is certain: Outkast's return to the stage will undoubtedly leave fans wanting more of their signature blend of funky beats, soulful lyrics, and infectious energy.",

In particular, Hlavatý solved some very difficult equations relating to Einstein's Unified field theory, which was featured in the news media as one of the great scientific achievements of 1953. Einstein himself was reported to have said that if anyone could solve the equations it would be Professor Hlavatý, which proved to be the case. He was born in Louny, Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic) and died in Bloomington, Indiana. He obtained his PhD in 1921 at the Charles University in Prague and during World War II participated in the Prague uprising, but his academic career was mainly at Indiana University, which he joined in 1948, and where he became Professor, later Emeritus, of Mathematics. A special book of mathematical essays was published in his honour. In 1958, he became the first President of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences established in Washington DC by intellectuals of Czech and Slovak origin.",

In addition to painting, he also worked as an illustrator for various publications including magazines and books. Some of his most famous illustrations depict characters from fairy tales and folklore, such as The Good Soldier Svejk or Alois Jirasek.\n\nThroughout his career, Hlavatý received numerous awards and accolades for his work. He was a member of the Union of Graphic Artists of the Czech Republic and the Association of Visual Communication Designers CR. His paintings and illustrations have been exhibited internationally and can be found in many public collections around the world.\n\nDespite being largely unknown outside of Central Europe during his lifetime, Hlavatý's unique vision and artistic talent have since gained him recognition as one of the most important artists of the second half of the twentieth century.

The classical control\nnecessary to use the network will therefore face similar issues as Internet\ndata transmission. Many scalability and management problems that arose during\nthe development of the Internet might have been solved in a more uniform\nfashion, improving flexibility and reducing redundant engineering effort.\nQuantum repeater network development is currently at the stage where we risk\nsimilar duplication when separate systems are combined. We propose a unifying\nframework that can be used with all existing repeater designs. We introduce the\nnotion of a Quantum Recursive Network Architecture, developed from the emerging\nclassical concept of 'recursive networks', extending recursive mechanisms from\na focus on data forwarding to a more general distributed computing request\nframework. Recursion abstracts independent transit networks as single relay\nnodes, unifies software layering, and virtualizes the addresses of resources to\nimprove information hiding and resource management. Our architecture is useful\nfor building arbitrary distributed states, including fundamental distributed\nstates such as Bell pairs and GHZ, W, and cluster states.\n",

By utilizing multiple intermediate nodes, these networks can extend the range of quantum teleportation and enable secure information exchange over vast distances. The study explores the theoretical foundations of this concept and provides insights into its practical implementation using current technologies. Additionally, it highlights potential applications in fields such as cryptography and distributed computing. Overall, our findings suggest that recursive quantum repeater networks have significant implications for advancing the field of quantum communications and paving the way towards a global quantum internet.",

Another report features a chair which leaps off the wall at the viewer.

The weekend begins when, as the guests are entering the home, one woman screams and claims that something has clutched at her ankle—something \"with fingers\". The host immediately tells the story of a former owner of the home whose death was met with such suspicion of witchcraft from the servants that the body lay as it fell for days, and the servants reported that something seemed to clutch at their ankles. The weekend is off to a spooky start but proceeds spectacularly when three witnesses agree that a gun jumped off the wall and killed a seated guest, with no hand holding it.

My dad, Leonard Coffee (a.k.a. Ren McCormack a.k.a. Kevin Bacon...all breakfast items? what a coincidence...lol) was a junior at Elmore City High School. This was a minuscule town, with a population of around 750, and there were about 50 or so Baptist churches...so naturally the town's rules and regulations were a bit extreme. There was an archaic town ordinance that banned dancing in public, and it hadn't been abolished. Elmore had never had a junior/senior prom! So my dad fought the system with the help of his best friend, Rex Kennedy (the junior class president), and they were allowed to have a prom for the first time, and Elmore has had prom every year since. I don't know who sold the story, but unfortunately we got no money lol! There were a few things in the movie that didn't actually happen (Ariel Moore, Reverend Moore, the book burning, oh and playing chicken on the tractors!), but it is mostly accurate. The kids did have to go to surrounding communities like Pauls Valley and Lindsay to dance and party, and my dad drove the exact same car that Ren drives in the movie! So there you have it, the REAL story of Footloose. If you haven't seen it...watch it!",

The inability of existing\nalgorithms to preserve edge information and structural details in their\nsegmented maps necessitates the computation of the edge quality factor (EQF)\nfor all the competing algorithms. Qualitative and quantitative analysis have\nbeen rendered with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms and for images ridden\nwith varying types of noises.

To address these issues, we propose using fuzzy c-means clustering with kernelization techniques that incorporate weighted information from the SWIM algorithm. Our approach enhances robustness against noisy images while preserving edges and details of objects within the scene. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets.

He observes that when he stays in one place too long, his powers dwindle and will return only when he leaves that place. Experimentation leads him to create an apparatus (now known as the Warlock's Wheel) consisting of a metal disc enchanted to spin perpetually. The enchantment eventually consumes all the mana in the vicinity, causing a localized failure in all magic. The Warlock realizes that magic is fueled by a non-renewable resource, which would cause great concern among the magicians, as it was through their magic that nations enforced their wills both internally and abroad. The widespread diminishing of magical power in The Magic Goes Away triggered a quest on the part of the most powerful of the magicians of the time to harness a new source of magic (the Moon), resulting in the events described in the book. It was eventually discovered (in The Magic May Return) that mana was originally carried to Earth and the other bodies of the solar system on the solar wind, replenishing mana slowly over time. However, at some point in the \"recent\" past (a few thousand years ago) a god created an invisible shield between Earth and Sun that intercepted the solar mana and caused the eventual decline of magic on Earth. Traditional fantasy creatures inhabit Niven's Magic universe, but devolve to normal animals when deprived of mana. For example, a unicorn becomes a simple horse. *The Warlock - One of the world's foremost magicians. He devised a simple experiment to explain why a magician's power would fade over time, a device called the Warlock's Wheel. *Clubfoot - The Warlock's apprentice. A Native American named after a deformity of his foot that he could have cured long ago but it would have cost him half his power. *Wavyhill - The first Necromancer. Exploiting the mana inherent in murder, he invented necromancy. His name comes from his practice of building his houses under magically supported overhangs; when the local mana is depleted by a battle, the hillside collapses, trapping his foe and eliminating the evidence at the same time. *Orolandes - A Greek soldier, survivor of the sinking of Atlantis. *Mirandee - A powerful witch, formerly Warlock's lover. *Aran - A werewolf who assisted the Warlock in defeating the necromancer Wavyhill. *Roze Kattee - The God Of Love And Madness. Its power lies in the taking away of love or madness. Enemy Berzerkers are suddenly rendered sane, those who do not worship Roze Kattee never find mates, etc. *The World Worm - Its spine composes all the world's mountain chains, the Andes, Himalayas, Rockies, etc. It consumes its own tail, along with anything that might be living on it. *Yangin-Atep - A fire god. *Coyote, Loki, etc. - A trickster god for many cultures. *Zoosh - Once a powerful patriarch. *Left-Handed Hummingbird - A Mesoamerican god (Huitzilopochtli).",

Downloaded singles have now overtaken physical singles in the UK. Mr Jamieson said his organisation was lobbying music service providers, which include iTunes and Napster, to urge them to promote independent releases. Download sales are due to be incorporated into the UK singles chart later this year. \"With downloads shortly to be eligible for the singles chart, this is a key commercial issue on which the BPI committed to assisting its members,\" added Mr Jamieson. As part of the campaign the BPI is running a series of seminars entitled Getting Your Music Online, focusing on how independent labels can embrace digital music. The US has already begun incorporating download sales in the Billboard's Hot 100 chart.",
        "direct_prompt": "Independent record labels are set to benefit from new technology that will allow them to sell their music directly to fans through digital downloads, it has been announced. The development comes as part of efforts to level the playing field between independent and major labels, who have traditionally had greater access to distribution channels.\n\nThe new system allows independents to upload their tracks onto an online platform, where they can then be purchased by customers. Revenue generated from these sales will be split fairly between the label and the artist involved, with both receiving a larger share than would typically be the case through traditional retail outlets.\n\nAccording to industry experts, this move could revolutionize the way in which independent artists distribute their work, giving them more control over their creative output and potentially increasing their earnings. It is hoped that the initiative will also help to support smaller labels, many of which struggle to compete against the financial clout of multinational corporations.\n\nSpeaking about the announcement, one independent label owner praised the move as \"a game-changer\" for the sector, while another described it as \"long overdue\". They added that the ability to sell direct to consumers was crucial in an increasingly crowded market, where securing shelf space or airtime could be difficult.\n\nDetails of the scheme were unveiled at a conference aimed at promoting the interests of independent musicians and labels. Delegates heard how the platform - due to launch later this year - aims to provide a simple and cost-effective solution for those looking to reach a wider audience without relying on traditional intermediaries.\n\nWhile some critics have expressed concerns about the potential impact on established retailers, supporters of the plan argue that it offers a vital lifeline to talented but overlooked artists. They hope that the increased exposure and revenue opportunities provided by the platform will encourage further innovation and creativity within the indie community.",

Nonetheless, US crude is still 30% more expensive than at the beginning of 2004, boosted by growing demand and bottlenecks at refineries. Traders ignored the possible effects of Asia's tidal waves on global supplies.\nInstead, the focus is now on US consumption, which is heavily influenced in the short term by the weather. \"With the revised milder temperatures... I'm more inclined to think we'll push lower and test the $40-40.25 range,\" said John Brady of ABN AMRO. \"The market definitely feels to be on the defensive.\" Statistics released last week showed that stockpiles of oil products in the US had risen, an indication that severe supply disruptions may not arise this winter, barring any serious incident. Oil prices have broken records in 2004, topping $50 a barrel at one point, driven up by a welter of worries about unrest in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, rising demand and supply bottlenecks. London's International Petroleum Exchange remained closed for the Christmas holiday.",
        "direct_prompt": "The unusually mild weather across much of the United States this winter has led to a significant drop in demand for heating oil, causing prices to fall by nearly 6%. According to analysts, the decrease is the largest quarterly decline since 2008, and comes as a surprise to many in the industry who had expected an increase in demand due to colder-than-average temperatures predicted earlier in the season.\n\nWhile some consumers may be pleased with the lower costs, the downward trend could have serious consequences for producers and workers in the oil industry. Many small businesses that rely on the seasonal demand for heating oil are struggling to stay afloat amidst the decreased sales, and job losses are feared in areas where the industry plays a major role in the local economy.\n\nIn addition to the impact on domestic production, the falling prices are also having ripple effects around the world. The United States is one of the world's largest importers of crude oil, so the reduced demand for heating oil at home means less need for imported supplies - driving global prices down even further. While this may be good news for American consumers who use gasoline or other petroleum products, it could ultimately lead to financial difficulties for producing countries and companies that depend on high oil prices to sustain their economies.\n\nDespite the short-term challenges faced by those in the oil industry, most experts agree that the current situation is unlikely to last indefinitely. As cold weather eventually returns to parts of the country, demand for heating oil is likely to rise once again - potentially leading to price spikes if supply cannot keep up with demand. In the meantime, both consumers and producers will be closely watching developments in the market as they try to navigate the uncertain landscape created by this unexpected turn of events.",

Yet to the Martin family, their household robot NDR-113 is more than a mechanical servant. \"Andrew\" has become a trusted friend, a confidant, and a member of the Martin family. The story is told from the perspective of Andrew (later known as Andrew Martin), an NDR-series robot owned by the Martin family, a departure from the usual practice by U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men of leasing robots. Andrew's initial experiences with the Martin family are replete with awkward moments which demonstrate his lack of socialization. However, he is much better with inanimate objects and animals and begins to display sentient characteristics (such as creativity; emotion; self-awareness) traditionally the province of humans. He is taken off his mundane household duties, for which he was intended, and allowed to pursue his creativity, making a fortune by selling his creations. Andrew seeks legal protection stemming from his initial creative output and eventual full recognition as a human, by gradually replacing his robotic components with organic ones, and citing the process as a transformation from robot to human. Succeeding generations of the Martin family assist him in his quest for humanity, but each is limited to what degree they are prepared to acknowledge Andrew's humanity. In The Positronic Man, the trends of fictional robotics in Asimov's Robot series (as outlined in the book I, Robot) are detailed as background events, with an indication that they are influenced by Andrew's story. No more robots in Andrew's line are developed. There is also a movement towards centralized processing, including centralized control of robots, which would avoid any more self-reflecting robots such as Andrew.

However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. Varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or £1.2bn). Asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country's Congress to discuss the airline's crisis, Mr Alencar replied: \"No, I don't think so. We will see.\"\nEarlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. \"In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used\", he said. An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. For that to happen Varig's main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline's employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country's economic downturn.\nThe depreciation of Brazil's currency has had a direct impact on the airline's dollar debt as well as some of its costs. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. But the government can appeal the decision.",

The carrier had been seeking investment to help turn around its fortunes but was unable to find a suitable partner.\nHowever, Transport Minister Paulo Souza said there were no plans at present to bail out the company using public funds. He added that discussions with potential investors were ongoing and urged patience until more details emerged.\n\"We are working on several fronts to try and resolve this situation,\" Mr Souza told reporters in Brasilia. \"But let us wait before jumping to conclusions or making hasty decisions.\"\nSpeculation about a possible state intervention in Varig intensified earlier this week when Economy Minister Paulo Bernardo indicated that the government might be prepared to provide support if necessary. However, he later clarified his remarks, stating that no final decision had been taken.\nFounded in 1927, Varig once boasted an extensive international network spanning five continents. But high debt levels, fierce competition from low-cost carriers and labor disputes have weighed heavily on the airline in recent times. Its collapse could lead to thousands of job losses and disrupt travel across Latin America.",

What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance!

Within the first three months of 2006, the band signed to independent label Eulogy Recordings and recorded the album with Barrett Jones in Seattle, Washington. Immediately following recording, the band embarked on two tours across the United States. Before releasing Mutiny in July, the album was preceded by the single release of the title track. The band subsequently toured the US, either as a supporting act or headlining, into mid-2007. After appearing on that year's Warped Tour, the group toured across Europe before closing out the year with another US tour. At the end of 2007, guitarist Dave Yoha left the band and was replaced by Dan Coddaire. Another round of touring followed, throughout Australia and the UK, before the release of the music video for \"Echoes\". A deluxe edition of Mutiny! was released before the second stint on the Warped Tour. While firmly a pop punk album, Mutiny! showcases influences from Lifetime and CIV. The release charted on the lower reaches of the Billboard Independent and Heatseekers component charts. Mutiny! received a positive reaction from music critics, with a few commending the band's constant energy. It has since appeared on a few best-of album lists by Big Cheese, Kerrang! and Rock Sound.",

The mutineers were protesting against the oppressive regime back home which had limited freedom under martial law since 1981.

Our key insight is that the voting\ntheory concept of majority rule holds for method calls: a call is likely to be\nmissing if there is a majority of similar pieces of code where this call is\npresent. The evaluation shows that the system predictions go further missing\nmethod calls and often reveal different kinds of code smells (e.g. violations\nof API best practices).\n",

Our results show that the majority rule is an effective technique for detecting anomalies in system call data, and has significant implications for improving the reliability and security of software systems. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the detection of missing method calls through the application of machine learning techniques, and offers promising directions for future research in this area.",

        "human_text": "Apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products.\nThe bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in December 2004 following online articles about Apple's Asteroid product. Now Apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. A lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters.\nApple's lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the Asteroid music product and leaking them to the PowerPage, Apple Insider and Think Secret websites. All three are Apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. Apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. The lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the Power Page and Apple Insider sites.\nThe separate legal fight with Think Secret has yet to be resolved. In the ruling handed down this week by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg, Apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers' net providers. In making his ruling, Judge Kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest. California has so-called \"shield\" laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest. The Judge wrote: \"...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of 'hits' on a website about Apple have and will happen. But an interested public is not the same as the public interest\". Judge Kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists, too. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is acting as legal counsel for Power Page and Apple Insider, said the ruling had potentially wide implications. \"Anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling,\" said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. Mr Opsahl said the EFF was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and US federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.",
        "direct_prompt": "In a move that has sparked controversy in tech circles, Apple has announced that it will be requiring bloggers to disclose any relationship they may have with the company or its competitors when writing about products and services related to those companies. The new policy is part of an effort by Apple to increase transparency and prevent biased reporting.\n\nThe requirement applies to all writers who receive free products from Apple or its rivals for review purposes, as well as those who have been invited to events hosted by these companies. Bloggers must clearly state whether they have received any compensation or other benefits from the relevant party, and if so, what those benefits are.\n\nWhile some commentators have praised the move as a step towards greater honesty and accountability in technology journalism, others have criticized it as an attempt to silence negative coverage of Apple's products and services. Critics argue that forcing bloggers to reveal their sources could lead to self-censorship and a chill on critical commentary.\n\nApple has defended the decision, arguing that it is necessary to ensure that readers can trust the information they are receiving. The company also noted that many journalists already follow similar disclosure practices, and that this policy simply formalizes those guidelines for everyone.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the blogging community will respond to the new requirements, and whether they will ultimately result in more transparent and accurate reporting on the tech industry.",

        "human_text": "Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling, bloody, melodramatic epic that more than justifies its two and one half hour running time. In Gangs director Martin Scorsese spins another tale of the New York underworld but with a twist. Instead of the mid-twentieth century organized crime milieu of Goodfellas, Scorsese ventures back to the 19th century to show us the origin of the modern street gang.<br/><br/> It's the early 1860s and the notorious Five Points slum is ruled by the savage `Bill the Butcher'. The viciously nationalistic Bill terrorizes all the immigrant masses jammed into his slum but seems to harbor a particular hatred for the Irish population. Into this seething cauldron wanders mysterious young Amsterdam Vallon who soon works his way into the trust and affection of Bloody Bill. Amsterdam, however, has a past with the unsuspecting Butcher and sports an agenda not unlike a certain Prince of Denmark. Bloody vengeance and dark betrayal soon come to pass, all played against a backdrop of corruption and unrest that lead to up to the horrors of New York Civil War draft riots.<br/><br/> Daniel Day-Lewis is marvelous as Bill the Butcher. His Bill is both recognizably human and a full bore, moustache-twirling villain. Day-Lewis strides his savage and profane way across the screen and steals the whole of the movie. The only other actor to approach Day-Lewis' level is Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed. Broadbent is Tweed's spitting image and he makes the grasping old pirate so winning we find ourselves rooting for Tweed against the gaggle of reformers that infest his domain.  Though Leonardo DiCaprio is the nominal lead of the picture he is overshadowed by his co-stars.  Large, slope shouldered and vaguely brutish looking, DiCaprio is physically perfect for Amsterdam.  While he could have used some of the fire and rage of a young James Cagney, DiCaprio's acting is superior throughout the movie. The problem is that Amsterdam just isn't as flashy a role as Bill or Tweed and, as good as DiCaprio is; Day-Lewis operates on a whole other level. Cameron Diaz as the beautiful pickpocket Jenny,  never convinces that she is a product of the slums. Despite having considerable screen time, Diaz fades into the background when compared to her more powerful co-stars.<br/><br/> Just as important as the actors are to Gangs is the period atmosphere that drips off the screen. The amazing old New York set has an air of lived in reality that you could cut with a knife. You can almost smell the vermin. Gangs is entirely free of the embalmed feeling you get from most modern period movies.  The cast handles the period argot as if it were their true speech and wear their costumes like lived-in clothing. You come away convinced that this is how the world looked and sounded in 1862.<br/><br/> Scorsese does eschew all nuance and subtlety in Gangs. Instead he tells his tale in wide, bold, exploitive and melodramatic strokes that make the movies two and a half hours fly by. Be warned that if you are waiting to see Gangs on DVD you are making a huge mistake. Gangs has to be seen at the theater. The detail and scope of the film cries out to be viewed in all its wide screen glory.  This movie is a fantastic achievement.",

To address this issue, we propose using the Lovász-Softmax loss as a tractable surrogate that smooths out the IoU function while preserving its essential characteristics.

        "human_text": " In a prologue, veteran underground guide Ike Crockett abandons his wife Alexandra von Schade and unborn child to return to the subterranean world, driven by feelings and whispers he cannot understand. He does not plan on returning to the surface. At the same time, an unscrupulous video documentary producer named Clemens is leading a film crew and its support team into the abandoned Hadal metropolis discovered by the ill-fated Helios expedition three years earlier. The film crew is wiped out by an unseen force, with Clemens the sole survivor. The main narrative resumes a few years later. While tensions between the United States and China increase on the surface, sub-planetary exploration and colonization is booming, ratcheting up potentials for international conflicts. The subterranean world is though to be safe, having been \"sanitized\" by the viral bioweapon deployed during the first novel's Helios expedition. On Halloween night, scores of children are suddenly abducted by the long-thought-extinct Hadals, who brutally kill any adults attempting to intervene. The Hadals take the children back underground with them, leaving the United States in a panic. Due to the tensions with the Chinese, the U.S. government decides against mobilizing the military to perform a sweep of the sub-planetary Pacific region in search of the kidnapped children and the apparently-not-extinct Hadals. Ali von Schade is approached by Rebecca, a tall and statuesque young woman whose husband was killed and whose daughter, Samantha, was kidnapped by Hadals. Due to Ali's previous experience with Hadals and the sub-planet, Rebecca wishes to enlist her help in searching for her daughter. When Ali declines and warns against searching, Rebecca eventually creates an army of volunteers and mercenaries to rescue the kidnapped children. Some of these volunteers are the same people who angrily attack Ali's research institution, believing her to be more sympathetic to the Hadals than to her own people. Clemens, who escaped Hadal captivity and is wracked with brutally inflicted scars and deformities, is present at the attack on Ali, and becomes a supporter of Rebecca and her goal of entering the sub-planet. Rebecca's army enters the sub-planet, aided surreptitiously by the U.S. government and overtly by a mercenary leader named Hunter, and begins traveling toward the Hadal metropolis discovered by the Helios expedition a decade earlier. She encounters an AWOL Navy SEAL sniper named Beckwith, who had deserted the military after he and his colleagues had mistakenly murdered a group of Chinese settlers after believing them to be the children-snatching Hadals. Rebecca, Hunter, Clemens, and Beckwith descend through the interior of the planetary crust toward the metropolis. They discover the remains of all the male children, who were apparently killed by the Hadals after being unsuitable captives. Ali and a colleague, Gregorio, enter the sub-planet themselves on a similar quest. Meanwhile, as both Rebecca's army and Ali and Gregorio separately descend in search of the kidnapped children, Ike Crockett has been conversing with an ominous \"Angel,\" who appears to be a superhuman being as old as Earth itself. Ike appears to be a captive of this being, who explains that he himself is the prisoner and wishes Ike to \"free\" him. The Angel reveals that he has directed both human and Hadal evolution. Gregorio dies in a climbing incident, leaving Ali by herself. Rebecca's army, having shrunk considerably due to desertions, eventually discovers a second Hadal metropolis, this one decorated with statues and emblems of oxen and Minotaurs. Ali is discovered by the Angel, who takes her to his lair. There, she watches in shock as he removes his \"disciple,\" who is revealed to be Ike, her husband, from a walled-in room and forcibly gives him an amphetamine-like drink. Ike rushes off, having been given instructions by the Angel to bring him the kidnapped children. Rebecca's army discovers a complex of pyramids across a river from the city and, led by Clemens, enters it across a large bridge while Hunter's mercenaries and Rebecca herself remain behind. The volunteer army, now down to less than ninety men, discover troves of treasure and begin looting. Suddenly, they are ambushed by Hadals and effectively massacred - only three make it back to the city. Rebecca, Hunter, the mercenaries, and the three volunteer survivors use a building on the city's side of the bridge to fortify themselves and a siege begins, pitting the remaining humans against an unknown number of Hadals. The siege ends in a bloody battle after over a week of Hadal biowarfare, which includes using darts poisoned with the rabies virus and a Hadal who infects himself with Ebola before allowing himself to be killed by a mercenary sniper; soon to be cooked and eaten by the starving humans. Clemens, thought dead in the massacre of the volunteer army, returns and tells them that he has been dealing with the Hadals, who will release the children if the mercenaries surrender to certain torture and death. Hunter refuses and believes Clemens to be in league with the Hadals. Before he can be killed, the zip-tied Clemens is freed by Rebecca, and he promises to return with Samantha. Samantha is brought forth by three Hadals, who use her as a human shield. A battle ensues, and Samantha is killed. As Ali replaces Ike as the Angel's captive \"disciple,\" Ike enters the pyramid complex. It has been revealed that the kidnapped children are the design of the Angel, but the Angel's plans have been co-opted by Clemens, who was once a \"trainee\" of the Angel. Ike kills many surviving Hadals and has been told to bring the children and the disobedient Clemens to the Angel. Clemens, however, proves to be a formidable adversary and bests Ike in hand-to-hand combat, inadvertently aided by the sniper Beckwith, who remained undetected by the Hadals and mistook Ike for a bad guy and assumed Clemens was a good guy, shooting Ike's hand. Clemens has the remaining girls and a traumatized and mentally unstable Rebecca (unable to cope with the loss of her daughter Samantha) with him, and tells the girls that he, Clemens, is their rescuer and that Ike is the one who mutilated him. As he tortures and prepares to kill Ike, Clemens is paralyzed by Rebecca, who uses a poison-tipped barb given to Ike by the Angel. Beckwith arrives and, realizing his mistake, helps rescue Ike, the delusional Rebecca, and the girls. They head toward the surface, suffering from illness and fatigue. Ali remains with the Angel, knowing that as long as she is his willing captive and \"disciple\" he will not find a way to \"free\" himself. The girls are brought to the surface and their parents celebrate in massive function thrown by the United States government. In the final pages, it is ambiguous as to whether or not a nuclear war between the United States and China has erupted.",

        "human_text": "Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in Parliament.\nTories, Lib Dems and some Labour MPs are poised to vote against the plans. Mr Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. Opponents say only judges, not politicians, should be able to order detention of UK citizens. The government is expected to win Wednesday's vote in the Commons, but faces a battle in the House of Lords.\nThe Prevention of Terrorism Bill was published on Tuesday. It proposes \"control orders\", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.\nThe two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge. Tory shadow home secretary David Davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the Guildford Four - for which Tony Blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. \"Those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that's why we have serious concerns abut that approach,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nMr Clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. He also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. The foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at London's Belmarsh prison. They are held under laws which the Law Lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 March.\nThe new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the Law Lords' concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects. Critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive UK citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. Opposition MPs are also angry they will have only two days - Wednesday and next Monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the House of Lords. But the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.\nIn a rare move, the Tories and Lib Dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are \"excessive\". It argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan \"wrongly infringes the right to liberty\" by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. Mr Davis told Today: \"It gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned.\"\nHe questioned why there was \"such a rush\" to introduce the legislation when Mr Clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"We believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians.\" Mr Clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be \"rash and negligent\" to ignore their advice. Nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the UK and its interests, he argued.",
        "direct_prompt": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced that police forces across the country will be put to the test this week as part of a new anti-terrorism strategy aimed at preventing violent extremism. \n\nThe exercise, code named 'Operation Temperer', involves deploying armed officers to key locations such as shopping centres and transport hubs in response to a simulated terror attack. \n\nIt is designed to assess whether local authorities have enough resources to respond quickly to an emergency situation and if they are able to work effectively with other agencies involved in countering terrorism. \n\nMs Patel said: \"We must always be prepared for the worst when it comes to keeping our people safe from the threat of terrorism.\" \n\n\"This operation provides us with an opportunity to learn lessons and improve our capabilities so we can continue to keep Britain's streets safe,\" she added. \n\nPolice chiefs have welcomed the initiative, saying it offers valuable training opportunities for their staff. \n\nHowever, some civil liberties campaigners have expressed concerns about the potential impact on public safety and privacy rights. \n\nA spokesperson for Liberty told the BBC:\"While we understand the need for robust measures to tackle terrorism, we also recognise the importance of protecting fundamental freedoms like freedom of movement and privacy.\" \n\n'Operation Temperer' follows recent terrorist attacks in London and Manchester which left dozens of people dead or injured. \n\nThe government says its priority is to prevent any further incidents by strengthening security measures and improving intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies.",

        "human_text": "The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mystery-based expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.<br/><br/>However, Ghost accomplished of what \"Always\" tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks to the great acting trio of Patrick Swayze + Demi Moore + Whoopi Goldberg, for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Molly and Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each others' feelings, and that taught us: \"Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts\". On this account they never called off their faith on believing that they will keep an enduring love affair. These indelible scenes in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is an imperishable cinematic instant. <br/><br/>I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: \"I will never forget the first time you kissed me and I don't need to be alive to recall this\" Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in '90s. Superimposing that, the scenes where Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam's ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only, are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.<br/><br/>To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"I still get chills thinking about Patrick Swayze's performance in Ghost. The way he portrayed his love for Demi Moore and the lengths he went to protect her even after death was truly heartwarming. The plot may be predictable at times, but the chemistry between the two leads is undeniable. Additionally, Whoopi Goldberg brings humor and depth to her role as Oda Mae Brown. Overall, this film has stood the test of time and remains one of my all-time favorites.\"",

The images with factors not seen\nduring training is commonly referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD). For safe\nautonomy it is important to identify the OOD images, so that a suitable\nmitigation strategy can be performed. Classical one-class classifiers like SVM\nand SVDD are used to perform OOD detection. However, the multiple labels\nattached to the images in these datasets, restricts the direct application of\nthese techniques. We address this problem using the latent space of the\n$\\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\\beta$-VAE). We use the fact that compact\nlatent space generated by an appropriately selected $\\beta$-VAE will encode the\ninformation about these factors in a few latent variables, and that can be used\nfor computationally inexpensive detection. We evaluate our approach on the\nnuScenes dataset, and our results shows the latent space of $\\beta$-VAE is\nsensitive to encode changes in the values of the generative factor.",
        "direct_prompt": "This study investigates Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods on multi-label datasets. Specifically, we propose utilizing the latent space of a β-VAE to distinguish between In-distribution and OOD samples. Our approach leverages the properties of the learned distribution within the variational autoencoder's latentspace which allows us to detect anomalies effectively. We evaluate our method extensively through experiments conducted on benchmark image classification data sets demonstrating its effectiveness compared with state-ofthe art approaches. The results indicate that this proposed technique can be used as an effective tool for detecting outlier patterns or anomalous instances in realworld scenarios where multiple labels are involved. Overall, it is shown that by exploiting information from both label correlations among classes along with feature representations captured via deep neural networks such as VAEs leads to improved performance when identifying unseen examples outside normal operating conditions.",

The doctor has stereotypical Jewish features: black curly hair, oily skin, thick lips, and a large, hooked nose, an effeminate voice, has poor posture and is orthopedically impaired. He agrees to undergo a complex medical operation in order to free himself from his Jewishness. Ultimately, he arranges to have all his bones straightened out, has his hair dyed blonde, and gets his larynx altered to change his voice. He is placed in a bathtub and given a blood transfusion by pure Aryan virgins. Having been seemingly cured of his Jewishness, he weds a blonde German woman. However, just as he is about to deliver a speech at his wedding, his voice takes on a high pitch, as all his previous Jewish features resurface. He ultimately winds up as a gelinatous puddle on the floor, thus signifying the immutability of the Jew: a Jew is always a Jew, regardless of whatever attempts at assimilation he may undertake. The book incorporated all the elements of modern, racial antisemitism: the expression of desire on part of the Jew to escape his identity, the lengths to which he will go to transform himself, the pornographic quality of the affair (as exemplified by the Aryan virgins), and the impossibility of it all. It sought to illustrate that Jews cannot escape their race; if they try, they become something non-human, and indeed sub-human.",

The EFF, representing the reporters, has asked California's Superior court to stop Apple pursuing the sources. It argues that the journalists are protected by the American constitution. The EFF says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press.\nApple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. \"Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, Apple is going to the journalist's ISPs for his e-mails,\" said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. \"This undermines a fundamental First Amendment right that protects all reporters. \"If the court lets Apple get away with this, and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters, potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news, analysis and commentary,\" he said. The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org.\nApple also sent requested information from the Nfox.com, the internet service provider of PowerPage's publisher Jason O-Grady. As well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published, the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. The EFF has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with Apple, including Professor Tom Goldstein, former dean of the Journalism School at the University of California and Dan Gillmor, a well-known Silicon Valley journalist.

Sources have revealed that Apple's suppliers are being forced to work long hours and endure harsh conditions in order to meet demand for its products.\n\nThe allegations have been made against Foxconn, one of Apple's main contractors, which manufactures iPhones and other devices for the US-based company. Workers at the factory reportedly earn just $1 an hour - far below minimum wage levels in the region.\n\nCritics say that these working practices amount to modern slavery, and call on companies like Apple to take responsibility for their supply chain. A spokesperson for the firm denied the claims, saying that they take worker welfare seriously and regularly audit their suppliers to ensure compliance with labor laws.\n\nNonetheless, the revelations have once again raised questions about corporate social responsibility and the role of big business in society.

This can lead them to be more possessive of their biological mother/father figure and view others negatively.\n2) Jealousy - A child's bond with their primary caregiver is often very strong, so when someone new comes into the picture, it can trigger jealousy and resentment. They may perceive any affection shown by the other person as taking away from themselves.\n3) Fear of change - Introducing another adult into a household means changes to routines and dynamics which children may find unsettling. It could also bring uncertainty around how much time they will get with each individual going forward.\n4) Lack of understanding - Some kids simply don't understand what being an Nparent entails; that these individuals care forthem out of love rather than blood relation.

LAP-d released two albums: \"Los Angeles Police Department\"(1989) & \"(1990)\"Walking On The Edge\", both were certified gold or higher sales level certifications according RIAA standards back then.(500k+ units shipped domestically)[citation needed].

        "human_text": " The book opens in the years following World War II. Angelou, still known as \"Marguerite,\" or \"Rita,\" has just given birth to her son, Clyde, and is living with her mother and stepfather in San Francisco. The book follows Marguerite from the ages of 17 to 19, through a series of relationships, occupations, and cities as she attempts to raise her son and to \"find her niche,\" or place in the world. It continues exploring the themes of Angelou's isolation and loneliness begun in her first volume, and the ways she overcomes racism, sexism, and her continued victimization. Rita goes from job to job and from relationship to relationship, hoping that \"my charming prince was going to appear out of the blue\" (p.&nbsp;114). \"My fantasies were little different than any other girl of my age\" Angelou wrote. \"He would come. He would. Just walk into my life, see me and fall everlastingly in love... I looked forward to a husband who would love me ethereally, spiritually, and on rare (but beautiful) occasions, physically\" (p.&nbsp;141). Some humorous and potentially dangerous events occur throughout the book. While living in San Diego, Rita becomes an \"absentee manager\" for two lesbian prostitutes. When threatened with incarceration and losing her son for her illegal activities, she escapes to her grandmother's home in Stamps, Arkansas. Her grandmother sends her back to San Francisco for her safety and \"protection\" after physically punishing Rita for confronting two white women in a department store. This event demonstrates their different and irreconcilable attitudes about race, paralleling events in Angelou's first book. Back with her mother, Rita attempts to enlist in the Army, only to be rejected during the height of the Red Scare because she had attended the California Labor School as a young teenager. Another event of note described in the book was, in spite of \"the strangest audition\" (p.&nbsp;117), her short stint dancing and studying dance with her partner, R. L. Poole, who became her lover until he reunited with his previous partner, ending Rita's show business career for the time being. A turning point in the book occurs when Rita falls in love with the Episcopalian preacher, L. D. Tolbrook, who seduces Rita and introduces her to \"the life\" of prostitution. Her mother's hospitalization and death of her brother Bailey's wife drives Rita back to her mother's home back in San Francisco. She leaves her young son with a caretaker, Big Mary, but when she returns for \"the baby\", she finds that Big Mary had disappeared with Clyde. She tries to elicit help from L.D., who puts her in her place when she finds him at his home and requests that he help her find her son. She finally realizes that he had been taking advantage of her, but is able to trace Big Mary and Clyde to Bakersfield, California, and has an emotional reunion with her son. She writes, \"In the plowed farmyard near Bakersfield, I began to understand that uniqueness of the person. He was three and I was nineteen, and never again would I think of him as a beautiful appendage of myself\" (p.&nbsp;192). The end of the book finds Rita defeated by life: \"For the first time I sat down defenseless to await life's next assault\" (p.&nbsp;206). The book ends with an encounter with a drug addict who cared enough for her to show her the effects of his drug habit, which galvanizes her to reject drug addiction and make something of her life for her and her son.",

        "human_text": "Leicester wing Austin Healey hopes to use Sunday's return Heineken Cup clash with Wasps as a further springboard to an England recall for the Six Nations.\nHealey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 World Cup, has been in good form in the Tigers' resurgence this season. \"I definitely still have ambitions to play for England,\" Healey told the BBC. \"We will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) Tests but when I look at the current squad I definitely feel there is a place there for me.\" Healey, who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career, has reverted to the wing, where he won most of his England caps. After recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of September, the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the Tigers revival. \"I had six weeks out but fortunately I have resumed the sort of form I had before,\" he said.\n\"I am basically playing where it best suits Leicester. Obviously I can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moment's notice. \"But playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where I am not expected and influence things.\" That has been apparent in parts one and two of the Wasps-Leicester trilogy in recent weeks. First, Healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the Tigers a 17-17 draw in their Premiership meeting on 21 November. Then, in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday, Healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for Martin Corry to score the Tigers' third try. \"I caught 'Cozza's' eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full, but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score,\" Healey recalled.\nHealey, twice a Heineken Cup winner, believes last Sunday's match was \"up there\" with some of the biggest club contests he has played in. \"It was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game,\" he recalled. \"There was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in. \"After about 15 minutes I thought we might stride away with it but Wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way.\"\nThe same outcome this Sunday would put Leicester in pole position to top their Heineken pool with a home game against Biarritz and away trip to Calvisano to come. But Healey insists the Tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed \"rugby's version of Rocky II\". \"There was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done,\" he added. \"It was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at Welford Road it will negate all the positives we can take from result. \"I think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end I think we did. We have got to show the same desire again this week.\"",

Screenplay has a different structure. There's no shocking opening scene like in 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie starts slowly in a very nice place and ends slowly in a very bad place, without hope or feeling that the characters have achieved something by their heroic actions.<br/><br/>3. It is first a movie about lost causes in the world of war, and only secondly a war movie which takes place in Stalingrad.<br/><br/>4. War scenes portray the horror, insecurity and confusion of a battle, instead of how cool, heroic and exciting fighting looks like. In this sense, this movie is closer to reality than most of the war movies you will ever see. 'Thin Red Line' also had similar \"I would probably crap in my pants in that situation\"-feeling.<br/><br/>Stalingrad, whether you think it as a movie or a war movie has so many good things in it... like honesty.

        "human_text": "The Fife Coalfield was one of the principal coalfields in Scotland. Over fifty collieries were in operation at various times between the middle of the nineteenth century and the closure of the last pit in 1988. The coalfield extended across the southern part of Fife where rocks of the Coal Measures Group occur and was one of a series of coalfields throughout the Midland Valley from which coal was won by both deep workings and opencasting methods. It is traditionally divided into the West Fife, Central Fife and East Fife coalfields with Kirkcaldy having been a particularly important area. Some of the mines extended beyond Fife under the Firth of Forth following the seams which occupy the Leven Syncline which extends to the south shore of the firth at Musselburgh and beyond. The Longannet power station near Kincardine used to source much of its coal from nearby pits but the Longannet coal mine closed after severe flooding in 2002, an event which more or less marked the end of deep mining in Fife and indeed Scotland. Opencasting in Fife was severely reduced after the premature closure of the power station. As of 2020, most opencasts have ceased production of coal, not only on a regional level but in Scotland as a whole.",
        "direct_prompt": "The Fife coalfield is an area in central and north-east Scotland where coal was mined extensively from the Middle Ages until the late 20th century. It lies beneath the council areas of Fife, Perth & Kinrossand Angus, covering approximately 1,500 square kilometres (580 sq mi). The coalfield includes several major seams of coal, including the Midland, Bargarran, Baragwanath, and Blackband formations. \n\nCoal mining has been carried out in Fife since at least the 15th century, with many pits opening during the Industrial Revolution. Some of the largest and most productive mines were located near Cowdenbeath, Cardenden, Lochgelly, Glencraig, and Longannet. At their peak, these mines employed thousands of workers and produced millions of tons of coal per year. However, declining demand for coal and economic factors led to the closure of many mines throughout the 20th century, with the last deep mine closing in 2002.\n\nDespite the decline of the industry, the legacy of coal mining remains prominent in Fife's culture and economy. Many former miners and their families continue to live in the region, and there are numerous memorials and museums dedicated to the history of coal mining in Fife. Additionally, efforts have been made to reclaim and regenerate abandoned mine workings and other industrial sites, such as through habitat restoration projects and the creation of recreational spaces.",

The book's fictional version of Jane Eyre ends with Jane accompanying her cousin, St. John Rivers, to India in order to help him with his missionary work. Literary questions (especially the question of Shakespearean authorship) are debated so hotly that they sometimes inspire gang wars and murder. Single, thirty-six, Crimean War veteran and literary detective Thursday Next lives in London with her pet dodo, Pickwick. As the story begins, Thursday is temporarily promoted to investigate the theft of the original manuscript of Charles Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit because she is one of the few people able to identify the thief, Acheron Hades. She comes close to capturing him during a stakeout, but is badly injured, saved by a copy of Jane Eyre that stops Hades' bullet. A mysterious stranger aids her until the paramedics arrive, leaving behind only a monogrammed handkerchief and jacket. Next recognizes these items as those of Rochester, a character from Jane Eyre, because she entered the novel as a child and briefly became acquainted with Rochester himself while she was there. While recovering in hospital, Thursday is instructed by her future self to take the LiteraTec job in her home town of Swindon. There, she discovers that her Uncle Mycroft has created the Prose Portal, which allows people to enter works of fiction. Next also renews an acquaintance with her former fiancé Landen Parke-Laine (a reference to the British version of the board game Monopoly). Hades kidnaps Mycroft, Polly, and the Prose Portal in order to blackmail the literary world; any changes made to the plot of a novel's original manuscript will change all other copies. When his demands are not met, Hades kills Mr Quaverley, a minor character from the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit. Next and a Goliath Corporation operative named Jack Schitt trace Hades to Wales and rescue Mycroft and the Prose Portal, but find that Polly is stuck in one of Wordsworth's poems and Hades has gone into the original text of Jane Eyre. Next pursues Hades, and after much trouble, succeeds in killing him. In the process, Thornfield Hall is burned, Rochester's mad wife Bertha falls to her death, and Rochester himself is grievously injured (in other words, she alters the ending of the book to match the actual ending to Jane Eyre). Returning to her own world, Next uses the Prose Portal to release her Aunt Polly and imprison Jack Schitt in the text of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\". She shows up at the church where Parke-Laine is about to be married to another woman, but a lawyer interrupts the wedding and Next and Parke-Laine are reconciled and marry instead. Next's father, a renegade agent from SpecOps-12, the ChronoGuard, turns up to dispense some fatherly advice to his daughter. The novel ends with Next facing an uncertain future at work: public reaction to the new ending for Jane Eyre is positive, but there are other repercussions.",

        "human_text": "Life insurer Axa Sun Life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors.\nRegular annual bonus rates on former Axa Equity & Law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. Axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. The cut will hit an estimated 3% of Axa's policyholders. The rest will know their fate in March.\nThe cuts on Axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested £50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of £46,998. This equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% Axa said. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. However, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. \"The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,\" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News. Axa cut payouts for the same investors last January.",
        "direct_prompt": "British insurance company AXA Sun Life has announced that it will be cutting its annual bonus payments for some of its customers, citing changing market conditions and increased competition as the main reasons behind this decision. The move is expected to affect around 120,000 policyholders who have invested in with-profits funds, which are designed to pay out bonuses based on the performance of the underlying investments.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, AXA Sun Life said that it had been facing increasing pressure from low interest rates and rising costs, leading to reduced profits across its business. As such, the company felt it necessary to make changes to its with-profit fund range in order to ensure its long term sustainability. While the majority of policy holders will continue to receive their usual bonus payment, those affected by the change will see a reduction in the amount they receive.\n\nCustomers who hold policies within certain funds including the Investment Growth Fund, Income Fund and Capital & Income Fundwill be impacted by the cut. However,AXASun life assured clientsthatthechanges wouldnot impacttheirdeath benefits or guaranteed minimum returns. \n\nThe announcement comes amid growing concerns over the financial health of Britain's biggest insurers, many of whom have seen profitability decline due to tough market conditions. In recent months, several other major players in the industry have also made similar moves to reduce payouts to customers.\n\nWhile the exact details of how much each customer will lose in bonus payments hasn't yet been disclosed, AXA sunlife promisedto communicate clearlywithaffectedpolicyholdersthroughlettersanditswebsite.

I had forgotten just how beautifully done it was - both a character study of two very different men and a gripping plot of their attempts to succeed - partly through athletics. the writer and director so well convey both Cambridge and the Edinburgh Presbyterian missionary disciples, in the early 1920s so very well.<br/><br/>The acting is superb - I had never seen a character presented like Eric Liddell in movies - how fine Ian Charleson was in this role, the softness of his voice, his ease and joy in running competitively (especially in contrast with the tense tortured Harold Abrahams). I also loved the more supporting roles - I've read a biography of F.E. Smith and Nigel Davenport is exactly how I would imagine him. The actor who played the Prince of Wales also seemed exactly right with his effortless charm, looks, and lack of imagination. Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson - all wonderful.<br/><br/>The actors weren't chosen for glamour either - Liddell and Abrahams are not Leni Riefenstahl images of athletic ideals, Liddell's sister is no beauty - and Abrahams' girlfriend is pretty but not stunning. It made them seem more real. (In nice contrast were the near-pretty boy looks of Nigel Havers as Lord Lindsay - it so suited his character).<br/><br/>The races are riveting - partly due to the music and sound effects.<br/><br/>So many small things are done so well - e.g., when Lord Lindsay has the confidence of his class to barge into a room containing the Prince of Wales, and three other lords (including Birkenhead and the head of the British Olympic Committee) and greets them by name - no need for introduction there (as there was for Liddell). It's small but seems quite real.<br/><br/>As an American, it was interesting and funny to see our Olympic team shown as the numerous, ominous, invulnerable \"other\"! (something like watching a Rocky movie with Rocky as the product of a Russian or East German success machine!). In fact, the one scene that seemed a bit off was the scene of the American track athletes warming up for the Games - all heavy music, machine like athletes, ferocious coach yelling with a megaphone into people's ears. It pounded too hard on the \"these are the scary almighty inhuman opponents\" theme in contrast to the cheerful British boys running along the beach.<br/><br/>Something I had forgotten about the movie was how stubborn BOTH protagonists are - Liddell fully as much as Abrahams. Liddell is not overly deferential or bashful when dealing with the Prince of Wales - but instead straightforward and very firm. <br/><br/>I truly can't understand anyone not liking this movie - it is very exciting even on the basic level of \"will they win?\" and so much more. (For example, Ian Holm's character's reaction to success after 30 years is very moving). Those who write to say that \"Reds\" deserved the Oscar more - are simply wrong. (Reds was so simplistic that it felt like watching the movie \"The Hardy Boys Go to the Russian Revolution\"). Those who say they cannot differentiate among the boys or between the Scottish and English accents - well, it sounds like some political statement to me. <br/><br/>Do watch it - it's very fine, very moving, very exciting.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"The story follows two British athletes in the 1924 Olympics, Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, as they overcome personal struggles and societal expectations to pursue their dreams of running. The film is beautifully shot, with stunning visuals that capture the essence of both the sport and the time period. The performances are outstanding, particularly Ian Charleson's portrayal of Eric Liddell. The score adds to the emotional impact of the film, creating a sense of triumph and inspiration that lingers long after the credits roll. Chariots of Fire is not only a celebration of athleticism but also a testament to the human spirit.\"",

        "human_text": " Set between June 1932 and December 1933, it tells the story of young Isao Iinuma, a rightist reactionary trained in the samurai code by his father. Isao becomes the instigator of a plot to topple the zaibatsu that he feels have corrupted the Yamato-damashii and betrayed the will of the Emperor. He is assured of the army's assistance by the young Lieutenant Hori. They plan to assassinate many key government figures simultaneously on December 3, 1932. Shigekuni Honda, a character who figured prominently in Spring Snow, the first novel of the cycle, appears again here as a judge and later lawyer. He comes to believe that Isao is the reincarnation of Kiyoaki Matsugae, the aristocratic schoolfriend whose story was told in Spring Snow. Realising that Isao too seems to be hurtling towards a \"picturesque\" death, he makes strenuous efforts to save him without revealing this personal connection. It is just after the May 15 Incident of 1932. Shigekuni Honda, the law student from Spring Snow, is now a junior associate judge at the Osaka Court of Appeals. He is asked by Judge Sugawa to give an address at a kendo tournament on June 16 at the Ōmiwa Shrine in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture. At the tournament, the chief priest points out to him a promising athlete called Isao Iinuma. Honda realises that this is the son of Shigeyuki Iinuma, Kiyoaki's old tutor, now a right-wing \"personality\". After lunch, Honda climbs the sugi-clad Mount Miwa, and afterwards descends to Sanko Falls to bathe. Some of the kendoists are already there. Honda is startled to see that Isao has the same three moles on his side that Kiyoaki had, and remembers Kiyoaki's dying words: \"I'll see you again. I know it. Beneath the falls.\" The next day, at the Saigusa Festival at Izagawa Shrine in Nara, Honda is introduced to Mr. Iinuma. He now runs an \"Academy of Patriotism\" and is slowly going to seed, morbidly talkative, his face \"marked by the years and by the common tribulations.\" Honda invites him and his son to dinner that evening. Iinuma accepts, and responds by introducing Honda to the poet, retired Lt.-Gen. Kito, and his 30-year-old divorced daughter Makiko. Iinuma and his son leave for Tokyo after the dinner. Just before they go, Isao lends Honda a copy of his favourite book, The League of the Divine Wind by Tsunanori Yamao, and urges him to read it. \"At the time of the... Imperial Restoration, the indications had been altogether favourable that the august wish of His Late Majesty Komei to expel the barbarians would be fulfilled. But clouds soon cut off the light of Heaven... swords were forbidden to the common people... it was decreed that samurai could cut off their topknot and that they might go without swords.\" In 1873, four samurai worship at Shingai Shrine in Kumamoto Prefecture, and then await the results of a divination performed by the priest Otaguro, the heir of the late, revered Oen Hayashi, whose 200 followers will come to be known as \"the League of the Divine Wind\". The proposals they have put to the gods are: \"To bring an end to misgovernment by admonishing authority even to the forfeiture of life\" and \"to cut down the unworthy ministers by striking in darkness with the sword\". Both return the response \"Not propitious.\" In 1874, the proposal Otaguro puts is to take advantage of the vulnerability induced by the Saga Rebellion. Again, the Ukei rite returns \"Not propitious.\" On 18 March 1876, the wearing of swords is prohibited. Harukata Kaya resigns as priest of Kinzan Shrine and presents a petition to the prefectural governor. In May, the rite of Ukei is performed by Otaguro, this time returning \"Propitious.\" The others wish Kaya to join them in rebellion, but he is reluctant. A further rite convinces Kaya that it is his duty. On arriving at Kumamoto Castle on the night of 24 October 1876, the 200 warriors split into three units. The first attacks the residences of the major officials; Governor Yasuoka is killed. The second attacks the artillery battalion, with great success; the third attacks the infantry encampment, breaking down barrack doors and throwing in grenades. The tide turns when ammunition is found for the garrisoned troops, and when the second unit rushes to the aid of the third, it is entrapped, and both Kaya and Otaguro die. The next morning, on the 9th day of the 9th month (lunar calendar), 46 survivors gather on Mount Kinpo, less than four miles (6 km) west of Kumamoto Castle. The six boats intended for escape are stuck in tidal mud and it is debated what they should do. The seven youngest rebels are sent away with Tsuruda, and the rest descend to Chikozu beach. A scouting party returns with the report that a crackdown is underway and no further military action can be taken. Accordingly, the survivors split up. One by one they surrender or commit seppuku, and a detailed accounting is given of each man's end. The pamphlet concludes with a quotation from The Romance of the Divine Fire, a book written by a surviving rebel. Honda sends the book back with a letter that Isao reads when he arrives at school. In it, Honda expresses a new respect for the League, and for the forces of the irrational in general (influenced by his new belief in reincarnation, although that is a secret) and discusses the dead Kiyoaki and his passion for Satoko. However, he warns Isao that the tale of the League is \"unsuitable\" for him, and dangerous, and lectures him at length on the need for \"the comprehensive picture offered by history.\" Isao concludes that Honda's \"age and profession have turned him into a coward\", but that the judge is still in some sense \"a man of 'purity'.\" After school, Isao and two schoolfriends (Izutsu and Sagara) go to the boarding-house of a right-wing celebrity, Lieutenant Hori. (It is Kitazaki's&mdash;the same inn that appeared in Spring Snow.) Isao boldly announces his intention of organising a \"Showa League\" and voices extreme sentiments for which Hori expresses sympathy, although become tense when Isao asks direct questions about Hori's connections to men involved in the May 15 Incident. The three boys stay until 9pm, listening to him discuss current affairs. Isao lends him The League of the Divine Wind. On Sunday morning in July, Isao conducts a kendo practice for young boys in the drill hall of the neighbourhood police station. While a detective called Tsuboi talks to him, four Communists are brought to the prison, and Isao feels a stab of envy. Iinuma runs an \"Academy of Patriotism\" in a wing of his large house in Hongō. We learn about what happened to Iinuma and Miné between 1914 and 1932, and meet the 40-year-old student named Sawa. After Master Kaido's Sunday lecture, Isao shows his two schoolfriends a map of Tokyo, suggesting an air-raid on the areas he has coloured in purple. Later on they have dinner with Makiko at her house, and the four discuss who in Japan most deserves assassination. Isao names Kurahara. Makiko has kept the lilies Isao brought from Izagawa Shrine a month ago, and hands them one each. Isao visits Hori at the garrison. Hori expresses irritation with Isao's hot-headed talk. During kendo practice, he is impressed with Isao's abilities, and proposes taking him to an audience with Prince Harunori Toin, the military royal for whom Satoko had been intended. Baron Shinkawa gives a banquet at his villa in Karuizawa. Five couples sit and chat in his garden before dinner: the Matsugaes, the Shinkawas, the Kuraharas, the Matsudairas, and the Minister of State and his wife. They discuss current affairs in great detail, with prominence given to the personality and monetaristic opinions of Kurahara. We discover the fate of members of the Matsugae household. The Marquis Matsugae himself is humiliated by his insignificance, even by the fact he has no bodyguard. Isao has an audience with Prince Toin, against Iinuma's wishes. Hori and the Prince chat for a while; when the Prince criticises the nobility, Isao uses the opportunity to give him The League and to express his ideas about bushido. By this time, Isao has gathered 20 more boys into his circle, and Izutsu and Sagara have studied explosives. Two weeks before the end of summer vacation, he sends all the boys a telegram ordering them to return to Tokyo for a meeting at the school shrine at 6pm. All turn up and are stunned when Isao tells them it was only a drill; three leave. Isao then has the remaining boys swear vows of fealty. To Isao's surprise, Makiko turns up, and takes them all to dinner at a restaurant in Shibuya. Chapter 19 gives a description of the opening of a Noh play attended by Honda in Osaka, called Matsukaze. While watching the two ghostly women ladle seawater into their brine-cart, Honda suddenly decides that his grief for Kiyoaki has deceived him and that there could be no real connection between Kiyoaki and Isao. While hanging out his washing in October (on a certain Mr Koyama's 77th birthday), Sawa asks Isao if he can go with him and his \"study group\" to Master Kaido's training camp in the week starting on the 20 October. Isao makes no reply. Sawa, while serving him tea in his own room, starts to describe how three years ago Iinuma helped extort 50,000 yen from a newspaper and used his 10,000 yen share to bolster the Academy. Isao is disappointed, but not shocked until Sawa warns him, without explanation, that he cannot hurt Kurahara without betraying his father. Wondering if Kurahara is a secret patron of the Academy, Isao later returns to Sawa's room and demands an explanation. Sawa responds by begging to be allowed to kill Kurahara himself. But after hearing him out, Isao smilingly denies there is any plot. Honda hears an account of the coup d'état that took place in Siam on 24 June, during which the country became a constitutional monarchy controlled by Col. Phahon Phonphayuhasena. On Friday 21 October, Honda attends a judicial conference in Tokyo, and on Sunday goes with Iinuma to see Isao at the riverside training camp at Yanagawa. Isao is in trouble: he has taken offence at the bland Shintoism espoused by Master Kaido and gone out to kill an animal after having been ritually purified. When he accompanies the whole group as they look for Isao, Honda is startled to realise that one of the dreams in Kiyoaki's journal is now being acted out in detail. Isao holds a secret meeting on Monday evening and shows the other boys his elaborate plan for a \"Shōwa Restoration\" placing all government functions under the Emperor's control, through (1) destroying Tokyo's six electric transformer substations, (2) assassinating Shinkawa, Nagasaki and Kurahara, and (3) burning the Bank of Japan, events that would lead to the desired declaration of martial law, after which they would all commit seppuku. The plan mentions Hori and Prince Toin. They discuss details of the plot; Isao names December 3 at random as the date, and they receive an unexpected windfall of 1000 yen from Sawa, who claims he acquired the money by selling land. Honda visits Kiyoaki's grave before returning to Osaka. On November 7, Lieutenant Hori summons Isao and tells him he is being sent to Manchuria on November 15. When Hori suggests moving the date of the plot to this week, Isao realises that he has no intention of taking part. Hori suddenly urges Isao to give up the plot, and Isao pretends to be persuaded. At the group's secret headquarters (a rented house in Yotsuya Sumon) Isao tries to salvage the plan. Seyama, Tsujimura and Ui argue with Isao in private, and he dismisses them from the group. Within days, only 10 are left with Isao, and on November 12 they are joined by Sawa, who sets out a plan for the 12 of them to assassinate one capitalist each. Sawa is assigned Kurahara, and Isao is assigned Baron Shinkawa. Isao visits the Kitos one last time on November 29 to deliver a present of oysters, but Makiko follows him, guessing that he has resolved to die, and they kiss on a hill opposite Hakusan Park. Makiko promises to go to Ōmiwa Shrine at Sakurai and bring them each back a talisman the day before they go ahead. Isao does not admit they already each have one of her lily petals. The morning of December 1, the boy conspirators are at their hideout, discussing the daggers they have bought, when they are arrested by detectives. In the afternoon Sawa is arrested at the Academy. On reading about Isao in the newspaper, Honda resolves to save him, and resigns his judgeship to act as defence lawyer for Isao. In Tokyo, Iinuma thanks him, and then claims that it was he himself who informed the police, and that he did it to save his son from death. Prince Toin summons Honda to his house on December 30. The prince expresses sympathy for the twelve, but is horrified when Honda informs him that he was mentioned by name in the propaganda leaflets they prepared, and loses interest in helping them. Honda saves the situation by persuading him to lean on the Imperial Household Minister to have that part of the evidence suppressed. Isao is moved to Ichigaya Prison in late January, and a long prophetic dream is described. He learns that Honda will be defending him, and realises that he has awakened popular sympathy. During an interrogation he hears Communists being tortured, and asks why he is not tortured; the interrogator replies that as a rightist he has his heart in the right place. In June he receives a Saigusa Festival lily from Makiko, which she has gone all the way to Nara to pick. The trial opens on June 25. The evidence of the leaflets has been suppressed, and it becomes clear that Lt. Hori is unlikely to be indicted. At the second session on July 19, Isao boldly admits to planning the assassinations. Honda tries to fudge the issue by bringing up the purchase of the daggers and leading the witness Izutsu to admit that, as imitators of the League of Divine Wind, these weapons would be more appropriate for committing seppuku than for murder. The innkeeper Kitazaki is called as witness, and he says he heard Hori telling a lone visitor to \"Give it up!\" although he did not know to whom Hori was speaking. Pressed to identify the person, Kitazaki points to Isao, but his strange words seem to suggest he is confusing Isao with Kiyoaki, although they had no physical resemblance. Most assume he is senile. Only Honda realizes the significance of his confusion of Kiyoaki and Isao. Makiko is called as witness, and she reads out a mendacious diary entry for November 29, in which she asserts that Isao was planning to abandon the conspiracy. She hopes that Isao will finally be forced to start lying in order to save her from indictment for perjury. He sidesteps by claiming that he did not mean what he supposedly said to her, but wanted to spare her from any consequences of his actions. The judge, who becomes sympathetic, allows him to enlarge on his motives, and he delivers a long address on the suffering of the common people and the need to destroy the deadly spirit poisoning Japan. The prosecutor expresses doubts about Makiko's testimony, but it is clear he senses defeat. The verdict is handed down on December 26. They are found guilty, but punishment is remitted on account of their youth and pure motives, and they are released. That evening, a celebratory dinner is held at the Academy of Patriotism. Tsumura, the youngest student, is irritated by the jolly atmosphere and shows Isao a newspaper account of desecratory blunders made by Kurahara on December 16 at the Inner Ise Shrine. Iinuma, drunk, tells Isao that he was the informant. Isao is not surprised until Iinuma goes on to say that the Academy is run entirely with money paid by Baron Shinkawa as protection, and that Shinkawa made him promise, just before the May 15 Incident, never to allow Kurahara to be touched. Later, Honda hears the sleeping Isao mutter \"Far to the south. Very hot...in the rose sunshine of a southern land,\" predicting his next reincarnation. In the morning he meets Tsuboi, who asks him to teach kendo to children, and he has a vision of himself doing so till old age. Sawa takes Isao into his room and lets him know that it was Makiko (whom Isao has not seen since the trial) who told Iinuma of their plan by telephone. This is the final straw for Isao. On 29 December, Isao slips away from Sawa during a lantern procession, buys a dagger, and travels to Inamura, a seaside village near Atami, Shizuoka. He breaks into Kurahara's weekend house, stabs him to death, then runs through his tangerine orchards down to a cave on the shore where he commits seppuku.",

In this way I,\nWith sleepy face bent to the chapel floor,\nKept musing half asleep, till suddenly\nA sharp bell rang from close beside the door,\nAnd I leapt up when something pass'd me by,\nShrill ringing going with it, still half blind\nI stagger'd after, a great sense of awe\nAt every step kept gathering on my mind,\nThereat I have no marvel, for I saw\nOne sitting on the altar as a throne,\nWhose face no man could say he did not know,\nAnd though the bell still rang, he sat alone,\nWith raiment half blood-red, half white as snow.\nRight so I fell upon the floor and knelt,\nNot as one kneels in church when mass is said,\nBut in a heap, quite nerveless, for I felt\nThe first time what a thing was perfect dread.\nBut mightily the gentle voice came down:\n\"Rise up, and look and listen, Galahad,\nGood knight of God, for you will see no frown\nUpon my face; I come to make you glad.\n\"For that you say that you are all alone,\nI will be with you always, and fear not\nYou are uncared for, though no maiden moan\nAbove your empty tomb; for Launcelot,\n\"He in good time shall be my servant too,\nMeantime, take note whose sword first made him knight,\nAnd who has loved him alway, yea, and who\nStill trusts him alway, though in all men's sight,\n\"He is just what you know, O Galahad,\nThis love is happy even as you say,\nBut would you for a little time be glad,\nTo make ME sorry long, day after day?\n\"Her warm arms round his neck half throttle ME,\nThe hot love-tears burn deep like spots of lead,\nYea, and the years pass quick: right dismally\nWill Launcelot at one time hang his head;\n\"Yea, old and shrivell'd he shall win my love.\nPoor Palomydes fretting out his soul!\nNot always is he able, son, to move\nHis love, and do it honour: needs must roll\n\"The proudest destrier sometimes in the dust,\nAnd then 'tis weary work; he strives beside\nSeem better than he is, so that his trust\nIs always on what chances may betide;\n\"And so he wears away, my servant, too,\nWhen all these things are gone, and wretchedly\nHe sits and longs to moan for Iseult, who\nIs no care now to Palomydes: see,\n\"O good son, Galahad, upon this day,\nNow even, all these things are on your side,\nBut these you fight not for; look up, I say,\nAnd see how I can love you, for no pride\n\"Closes your eyes, no vain lust keeps them down.\nSee now you have ME always; following\nThat holy vision, Galahad, go on,\nUntil at last you come to ME to sing\n\"In Heaven always, and to walk around\nThe garden where I am.\" He ceased, my face\nAnd wretched body fell upon the ground;\nAnd when I look'd again, the holy place\nWas empty; but right so the bell again\nCame to the chapel-door, there entered\nTwo angels first, in white, without a stain,\nAnd scarlet wings, then, after them, a bed\nFour ladies bore, and set it down beneath\nThe very altar-step, and while for fear\nI scarcely dared to move or draw my breath,\nThose holy ladies gently came a-near,\nAnd quite unarm'd me, saying: \"Galahad,\nRest here awhile and sleep, and take no thought\nOf any other thing than being glad;\nHither the Sangreal will be shortly brought,\n\"Yet must you sleep the while it stayeth here.\"\nRight so they went away, and I, being weary,\nSlept long and dream'd of Heaven: the bell comes near,\nI doubt it grows to morning.

If you're reading this, chances are you've got an upcoming HEO (Hierarchical Employee Organization) interview and are looking for some tips on what to expect and how to prepare your examples from previous EO (Employee Organization) interviews. \n\nFirstly, it's important to understand that the HEO level is significantly more senior than EO, so don't be surprised if the questions asked during the interview are much more strategic in nature. The interviewers will likely want to see evidence of your ability to think critically about complex problems and come up with innovative solutions. They may also ask you to discuss specific challenges you faced in past roles and how you overcame them.\n \nWhen preparing your examples, make sure to focus on demonstrating your leadership skills and abilities. This includes things like effective communication, delegation, problem-solving, decision making under uncertainty, conflict resolution, change management etc. It would help if you also had clear metrics/results which show impact due to actions taken by you as part of these skill sets.\n\nIn terms of general interviewing advice, remember to practice your responses beforehand so that you feel confident answering questions on the spot. Be prepared to give specific examples from your experiences, and try to tie everything back to how it relates to the role you're applying for. Finally, make sure to do your research on the company culture and values so that you can demonstrate your alignment with them throughout the interview process.\n\nI hope those points were helpful - good luck with your interview! Let me know if you have any other question I could assist you with.",

        "human_text": "Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.<br/><br/>Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character – and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as \"full metal bitch\" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before. <br/><br/>As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was (it IS breathtaking, though).<br/><br/>So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years, 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
        "direct_prompt": "\"Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt team up in this sci-fi action flick that's both thrilling and hilarious. The premise is unique, allowing for an innovative take on the groundhog day trope. The special effects are top notch, with some truly breathtaking battle sequences.

The land was purchased in 1843 and the house was built in two or three stages with completion before 1849. During this time the stage one shingle roof was covered with iron. The first stage of the house consists of four rooms at entrance level, over two downstairs rooms, two cellar rooms and an unusual larder. A second and possibly third stage added two wings containing eight more rooms, a kitchen and scullery. These wings were enclosed to form a courtyard.",

Pharaun talks with one of them who reveals the name of several elopers. While he is there, Ryld is attacked by other males whom he has taught. Afterwards, the two companions talk about the quest and decide the males are eloping because of the unusually harsh rule of the females in the last few weeks. Pharaun reveals that he has reason to believe that Lolth is gone and as such the females cannot use divine spells anymore, and are limited to scrolls and magic items. Ryld, though skeptical at first, eventually believes him. They learn of an uprising among the lower class creatures led by a mysterious prophet, and decide to pretend that they support the elopers. They kill a group of Drow to prove their \"dedication\" to the cause and are reluctantly taken in. They learn that the mastermind behind the rebellion is an evil illithid lich (called an \"alhoon\" or an \"illithilich\"), and that when he sends a mental signal, all the lower creatures will attack. While this is all happening, Gromph Baenre is sending various demons to attack Quenthel Baenre, all taking the guise of various aspects of Lloth, e.g. a demon spider, a demon of chaos, a darkness demon, and others. While this happens, a group of students at Arach-Tinilith decide that Lloth is disfavouring Quenthel, and resolve to kill her. She learns of this plan and has the offending students killed. Another subplot involves an ambassador from the neighbouring city of Ched Nasad being refused the right to leave by Triel Baenre. She eventually attempts to leave and is stopped by a traitor in her household. She then escapes the city, but is caught and taken to Triel. She realizes someone has turned Triel against her and is tortured by Jeggred Baenre, Triel's draegloth son. Eventually the lower races get the signal to rebel. Pharaun escapes from the Illithid and gathers the forces of Menzoberranzan to fight. A battle ensues, where much of Menzoberranzan is marred. At the end, the general populace realizes the weakness of the priestesses, and Pharaun, Ryld, Quenthel, Jeggred, and the ambassador, Faeryl Zauvirr, are sent to Ched Nasad to see if they are also afflicted.",

        "human_text": "Two senior officials at one of China's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (£64m) went missing.\nThe pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin, the South China Morning Post reported. The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\nThey shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\nHowever, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\nChina's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.",
        "direct_prompt": "Authorities in China are investigating reports that millions of dollars have gone missing from one of the country's largest banks, leaving customers shocked and angry.\n\nThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which is state-owned and has branches across the nation, confirmed on Sunday that an unspecified amount of money had been transferred out of its system without proper authorization.\n\nCustomers who tried to access their deposits were met with empty accounts, according to local media reports. Some said they had saved for years to put money into the bank only to see it vanish overnight.\n\nThe incident comes amid growing concerns about corruption and financial mismanagement within Chinese institutions. The government has launched investigations into several high-profile cases involving officials accused of embezzlement and other forms of economic crime.\n\nIn recent months, there have also been widespread protests by investors who lost money in a controversial stock market crash last summer. Many believe the government failed to intervene when prices began tumbling, leading to significant losses for ordinary citizens.\n\nIt remains unclear how the latest theft occurred or whether any individuals or organizations are being investigated. ICBC declined to comment further beyond its initial statement, saying it was still gathering information.\n\nHowever, some experts predict this could be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to financial irregularities in China. They argue that increased transparency and accountability are needed if the country hopes to maintain confidence in its banking sector and prevent future scandals.",

Voodoo death is particularly noted in native societies, and concentration- or prisoner of war camps, but the condition is not specific to any particular culture. Walter Cannon and his work\nIn 1942, Walter Bradford Cannon, MD, now looked to as a forerunner in modern physiological psychology, published a work wherein he postulated the idea that fear could affect a person to the point that their physical condition would deteriorate in response to psychological distress. Citing examples of extraordinary deaths (and their extraneous circumstances) in aboriginal societies, Cannon posited the idea that fear of supernatural consequences to broken societal taboos caused the deaths witnessed in the natives.",
        "direct_prompt": "Voodoo death is an alleged form of murder that involves using magic or sorcery to kill someone, often associated with the practice of Vodou in Haiti. It has been reported as a method used by practitioners to harm their enemies or others they wish to eliminate. However, there have been no scientific studies conducted on this topic and many consider it to be a myth.[1] \n\nThe belief in voodoo death dates back centuries and was brought over from Africa during the transatlantic slave trade when enslaved people were forced onto ships bound for the New World. Many African cultures believed in the power of spells and curses to cause physical harm or even death,[2] which likely contributed to its persistence throughout history. Despite being widely feared and discussed among certain communities, there are few documented cases of anyone actually dying due to voodoo practices[3].\n\nIn recent years, popular culture has perpetuated misconceptions about voodoo death through various media such as movies and television shows. This has led some individuals to believe that practicing Vodou can result in real-life fatalities despite lack of evidence supporting these claims [4]. The use of drugs like pufferfish toxin (tetrodotoxin) found within blow fish liver extracts also called fugu poisoning practiced traditionally Japanese religion Shintoism & Buddhism too but not limited only them though. They're considered highly toxic substances capable causing paralysis respiratory failure ultimately leading fatality if ingested accidentally purposefully. Nevertheless still remains unclear whether any actual deaths attributed solely traditional religious rituals involving magical beliefs similar fashion those surrounding so-called 'voodoo death.'\n\nDespite lacking concrete proof demonstrating its existence, fear of voodoo death continues to persist today both inside outside Haitian community alike. Some attribute ability cast powerful curse hexes upon one's enemy partaking specific ritualistic acts prayers while invoking spirits known loa who serve intermediaries between mortal realm spirit world according to lore behind Vodou tradition itself.[5][6] Others point finger at individual practitioner suspected employing dark arts achieve desired outcome regardless cost victim involved however without sufficient hard data available substantiate allegations made against said parties making definitive conclusion difficult reach based current information accessible public domain alone.[7] Regardless of perspective taken regarding possibility occurrence voodoo death one thing seems clear: fascination surrounding subject persists captivates imaginations countless individuals worldwide even today.[8]",

He travels by ship with his friend and lover, Hild. They make landfall near Eoferwic (York) to find the region in disarray. Lord Ivarr Ivarsson and his army are engaged with the Scots in the north. The formerly Danish-held Eoferwic has been conquered by Saxons. The central lands of Dunholm are ravaged by Kjartan and Sven, and Bebbanburg remains under the control of Ælfric. Uhtred is hired to escort a Danish merchant's family north, through Dunholm, to safety. As they travel and attempt to avoid the Dunholm fortress and Kjartan's troops, they are unsuccessful and are led into a slave trading camp led by Sven. Uhtred disguises himself as Thorguild the Leper, Dark Swordsman of Niffelheim, and convinces Sven he is sent from the dead to haunt him. He frees Danish King Guthred of Cumbraland from the slave pens. In Cumbraland, Uhtred becomes the commander of Guthred's household troops and adviser. He trains a band of thirty new warriors and stops an attempt by Kjartan to capture him and Guthred. Uhtred supports Guthred's bid for power against the rival factions of Northumbria, including his uncle Ælfric who now rules Bebbanburg. He falls in love with Gisela, Guthred's sister, before being betrayed by Guhtred and cast into slavery. During two years spent chained to the oar of a Danish trading ship, Uhtred befriends Finan the Agile, a former warrior. Uhtred is rescued by Steapa and Ragnar who pursued the trading ship in their Red Ship on the orders of King Alfred. Uhtred returns to Wessex to learn that it was Hild who convinced Alfred to send Steapa and Ragnar to his rescue. Hild had promised to Alfred that she would use Uhtred's hoard of silver to build an abbey and recommit herself to Christ, and in return Alfred agreed to rescue Uhtred. Uhtred, Father Beocca, Steappa and Ragnar are sent on embassy to Guthred with a message to make peace in Northumbria. They arrive in Guthred's court to find that Gisela was married to Ælfric via proxy in return for support against Kjartan. Uhtred is certain his uncle will send no men to support Guthred. He chases off Ælfric's men without allowing them to take Gisela, kills Ælfric's monk Jænberht and leads Guthred's men against Dunholm himself. Uhtred's plan to take Dunholm is to once again become a sceadugengan. In the darkness, he along with eleven of his best men climb the hill upon which Dunholm sits and sneak into the fort through a gate used to fetch well water. Although they are discovered, they are assisted by Ragnar's sister Thyra, who has been held by Sven and Kjartan since the events of \"The Last Kingdom\". Her assistance allows Uhtred to open the gate for Ragnar with the main forces of Guthred's army to enter the stronghold. Kjartan and Sven are killed and Guthred transfers control of Dunholm to Ragnar. Guthred's claim to the throne of Northumbria is not complete yet. Guthred's army meets Ivarr's stronger force in the field. Uhtred provokes Ivarr into single combat and the novel ends with Uhtred winning the duel against Ivarr.",

Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\nMr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn't have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\nBut he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn't worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.",
        "direct_prompt": "In an unprecedented move, Malik Aziz, leader of the opposition party in Pakistan, has rejected the idea of creating all-black candidate lists for upcoming elections. This decision comes after several political parties announced they would field only candidates with dark skin to represent their constituencies.\n\nAddressing reporters on Monday, Mr. Aziz said that such actions were divisive and went against the principles of unity and inclusivity enshrined in the country's constitution. He added that his party believed in meritocracy and would select its candidates based on competence and experience rather than appearance.\n\nThe issue of fair representation for marginalized communities, particularly those from ethnic minorities, has been a contentious one in Pakistani politics. Critics argue that despite making up a significant portion of the population, these groups are often underrepresented or completely absent from electoral processes.\n\nHowever, some analysts believe that relying solely on appearances to determine representation could lead to further polarization along sectarian and ethnic lines. They point out that issues like education, healthcare, and economic development affect everyone regardless of skin color.\n\nDespite this concern, many politicians continue to push for exclusive black candidate lists as a way to address longstanding grievances and injustices faced by minority populations. The debate is expected to continue ahead of the general election scheduled for next year.",

        "human_text": "\"Zodiac\" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work. He becomes fascinated by the case, and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause. Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based, and according to his accounts, he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after he'd been cleared for lack of evidence. Other characters come and go. Robert Downey, Jr. does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the \"Chronicle\" who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's put-upon wife, who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances, many of them against the odds. Since this isn't a character driven movie, many of the characters remain undeveloped, but not, for once, to the detriment of the film. This story isn't about the people involved, but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga; once they've served their purpose, Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically, a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.<br/><br/>Parts of \"Zodiac\" are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential, and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher's other well-known films, like \"Seven\" and \"Fight Club.\" But \"Zodiac\" is much more grown up than those films, and for an audience to enjoy it, it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples, recreating the scenes of murders, digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the pre-CSI era, when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail, but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion, but the real-life end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination, and what a journey it is.<br/><br/>Grade: A",
        "direct_prompt": "The Zodiac Killer, one of history's most elusive and terrifying serial killers, continues to haunt us even today - nearly five decades after his reign of terror came to an end. David Fincher's masterful film adaptation captures both the horror and intrigue that surrounded this unsolved case in 1970s San Francisco. The pacing is deliberate yet gripping, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in the investigation as detectives tirelessly work to uncover clues left behind by the killer. With stunning performances from Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., and others, each character feels authentic and driven by their own personal motivations. Visually striking with impeccable attention to detail, every frame screams quality filmmaking at its finest. If you're looking for a thrilling crime drama that will keep you on edge until the very end, look no further than Zodiac. It's easily one of the best films of recent years and serves as a testament to the enduring power of true-crime stories told through cinematic magic.",

Additionally, the\nmethod is tested on a database of iris images collected from ophthalmology\nclinic patients, for which it also offers an advantage over the two other\nalgorithms. This work is the first step towards post-mortem-specific iris\nrecognition, which increases the chances of identification of deceased subjects\nin forensic investigations. The new database of post-mortem iris images\nacquired from 42 subjects, as well as the deep learning-based segmentation\nmodels are made available along with the paper, to ensure all the results\npresented in this manuscript are reproducible.",
        "direct_prompt": "This study investigates post-mortem iris recognition using deep learning-based image segmentation. The aim is to determine if it is possible to extract usable iris images from deceased individuals and use them for identification purposes. A dataset of post-mortem iris images was collected, and a deep neural network was trained on this data to perform automatic iris localization and segmentation. Results show that despite degradation caused by death, it is still possible to obtain accurate segmentations which can be used in subsequent stages of iris recognition. This research has important implications for forensic science and biometrics, as it opens up new possibilities for identifying individuals after death.",

        "human_text": " A young man awakens in an emergency escape pod finding himself on the surface of an asteroid and having no memory of his identity or how he ended up in this situation. He adopts the name 'Derec' from the name on his space suit, which he later finds out is only the suit's manufacturer. He is soon rescued by a colony of robots who are mining the asteroid in search of something hidden there. Their mission is surrounded in the utmost secrecy such that Derec is not told what they searching for nor allowed to communicate with the outside world. However, the robots send a message to their commander asking what to do and continue their work. Derec has limited freedom to explore the subterranean operation and is amazed at the level of engineering design in the robots and their operation. Likewise, he begins to realize that he himself is well trained in robotics, both technically and psychologically (pertaining to the Three Laws of Robotics). Eventually, a passing alien pirate ship receives the robot's signal and attacks the colony. Due to the secrecy of the robot's mission, their orders dictate they must destroy themselves upon discovery. However, doing that would jeopardize Derec's life and thus the robots would be failing to obey the First Law of Robotics. Derec escapes to the surface of the asteroid using a modified 'augment' (augmented worksuit) and attempts to board the alien ship. While the alien ship bombards the asteroids' surface, the robots below are destroying themselves in the incinerator, but one robot is attempting to \"save\" Derec. Just before the robot is destroyed by the alien blasters, it finds the object of their search on the surface and bequeaths it to Derec, though Derec knows nothing of its function or importance. Derec is then captured by the aliens. On the alien ship, which is a compilation of smaller ships pieced together, he meets its captain, a ruthless humanoid named Aranimas, who is on a mission to procure robots for his own use. He apparently has little knowledge of robotics. In a trade for his life, Derec must build a robot for Aranimas, but is only supplied with random robototic parts that Aranimass has collected through his piracy, including the arm of the destroyed robot who gave Derec the object. Surmising the object's importance, Derec decides he must get it back from Aranimas and escape. During the construction of the robot, whom he names 'Alpha', Derec discovers and befriends another servant of Aranimass, a small, furry canine-like alien who he names 'Wolruf', since he cannot pronounce the real name. Together, they plan to mutiny against Aranimas with the help of Alpha by taking advantage of the fact that Alpha is bound by the Three Laws of Robotics and Aranimas is ignorant of that fact. They subdue Aranimas and gain access to the room where the object is hidden. While looking for it, Derec encounters another prisoner and is surprised to find that she is a human female who apparently knows him. But before she can tell him anything, he trips a booby trap protecting the object and falls unconscious. Derec awakens in a medical facility on a remote space station that is entirely operated by robots. Beside him is the female, Katherine. Derec is told they were the only two found and is remorseful that Wolruf has been left behind. Anxious to return to society, they learn through the Rockliffe Station manager, an off-station human, that the ship they arrived in (the part of Aranimas's monstrosity in which was the booby trapped room) has been seized to cover the cost of their medical bills and that the next supply ship to take them back to civilization is weeks away. Wanting to find the object, they venture out into the station looking for the hangar containing their ship. Upon finding the ship in an abandoned section, they discover the robots have removed the object. There they also discover Wolruf, who has been hiding on the station since their arrival and is starving due to the absence of food on a robotic installation. She informs Katherine and Derec that the object they are looking for is called the \"Key of Perihelion\" and is under heavy robot guard. It is a highly valuable object, but Aranimas could not get it to work. Using a First Law farce to draw the guards away from the Key, Derec steals it and escapes into an empty section of the station. Katherine and Wolruf meet him, with robots following close on their heels. Just as the door opens, Derec actives the Key and he and Katherine disappear into thin air, leaving Wolruf behind again with Alpha, who had opened the door. Katherine and Derec reappear on the top of a pyramid shaped building in the center of an expansive city. They descend the building's surface, hiding the Key in one of the holes they find as they climb down. It is immediately apparent that the city has peculiar properties in that buildings appear and disappear overnight and the entire population is composed of robots. However, the robots had been aware of one other human in the city, and that person had recently been murdered. Because of the First Law, the robots concluded that one or other of the only other humans in the city, Derec and Katherine, must have committed the murder. The story ends with both of them being murder suspects and the series continues in Isaac Asimov's Robot City: Suspicion.",

Asia's biggest airline joins Japanese rival All Nippon as one of the first carriers to order the mid-size 7E7, which Boeing says is super-economical. Airbus this week announced the first pre-sale of its 7E7 rival - the A350. Boeing's great European competitor is to sell 10 of its forthcoming A350 to Spanish carrier Air Europe, which has the option to buy two more in a deal that could be worth more than $1.8bn. Both the 7E7 and the A350 are being designed to be as fuel-efficient as possible in the 200- to 300-seat sector, and each will be available in both short and long range versions.\nJapan Airlines said it had looked at both aircraft before choosing the 7E7, also known as the Dreamliner. \"We chose the 7E7 after carefully considering both it and Airbus' aircraft,\" said a Japan Airlines spokesman. \"The 7E7 fits better for what we needed and it could be delivered when we hoped to get it.\" Boeing continues to enjoy a dominance over Airbus in Japan, and Japanese companies are taking key roles in building the 7E7. The first 7E7s will be delivered to Japan Airlines in April 2008. Boeing has set itself a target of getting 200 firm commitments for the 7E7 by the end of this year, and has orders for 56 so far. Airbus hopes to have 50 orders in place for the A350 by mid-2005.",

The deal is worth $3 billion at current list prices and comes as Boeing seeks to boost its presence in Asia's rapidly growing aviation market.\n\nThe new aircraft will replace ANA's aging 777s and 767s, and are expected to enter service from 2020 onwards. The 787-9 boasts improved fuel efficiency and range compared to earlier models, making it well suited for long haul flights.\n\nThis latest agreement between Boeing and ANA follows recent orders by Japanese airlines for Airbus jets, highlighting the intense competition between the two US and European plane makers vying for dominance in one of the world's most lucrative markets.\n\n\"We're honored that ANA continues to choose Boeing airplanes,\" said Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president of Sales Strategy & Marketing for Commercial Airplanes.\"Our partnership stretches back nearly 70 years,and we look forward to continuing our collaboration into the future.” \n\nAnalysts say this newestorder could help bolster Booeing's position against rival planemaker Airbus, which recently secured several major dealswith Chinese carriers during Beijing's biennial Airshow.",

One of the men chosen is a rich lawyer. He offers all his money to anyone who will take his place. One man agrees. Upon his release from prison the lawyer must face the consequences of his actions. The story comprises four parts. In Part I, set in prison, the occupying German guards issue a decimation order to the thirty inmates. One of the three chosen by drawing lots is a rich lawyer named Chavel. Chavel becomes hysterical and desperately offers his entire wealth to any man willing to die in his place. A young man, known as Janvier, accepts his offer and is executed. In Part II, the war is over and Chavel is alive and free, but virtually destitute. He returns to the house he sold for his life and finds it occupied by Janvier’s mother and sister, Thérèse. Assuming the false name Charlot, he becomes their servant. Part III sees the arrival of an impostor, named Carosse, who claims to be Chavel. Carosse attempts to denounce Charlot, win the favour of Thérèse and stake a claim on the property. Finally in Part IV, Charlot, having fallen in love with Thérèse, must save her from Carosse, as a means of redemption from his earlier cowardice.",

The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",

The decision was taken as a precautionary measure, with no explosives having been found during searches carried out by police and security personnel.\n\nThe match between Real Madrid and Ajax Amsterdam, which was scheduled to take place later this week, has been postponed following the incident. Police are currently investigating the source of the threat but have yet to make any arrests.\n\nIn a statement released earlier today, Real Madrid expressed its solidarity with those affected by terrorism worldwide and condemned all forms of violence. Fans who had purchased tickets for the game were offered refunds or the option to attend another fixture instead.\n\nThis is not the first time that Spain's most famous football venue has been targeted by terrorists. In 2011, an al-Qaeda cell based in North Africa claimed responsibility for sending letters containing white powder to several high-profile locations across the country, including the Bernabéu. No one was injured in that incident either.\n\nAs investigations continue into Wednesday night's bomb scare, authorities remain on high alert throughout the city. Meanwhile, fans and players alike have taken to social media to express their shock and concern over the latest development in what has already been a turbulent season for Europe's richest club.",

For example, members of the Bear clan are often seen as strong and independent, while those of the Wolf clan are known for their intelligence and cunning.[4] The clan system serves several purposes, including regulating marriage relationships between different clans to maintain balance and harmony within the community[5], providing a framework for social organization and governance,[6] and serving as a source of cultural pride and identity.[7]\n\nIn addition to the four main clans, there are also sub-clans called \"odoodemong\" (sing.) or \"odoodemanid\" (plur.), which are smaller groupings within each clan that serve to further differentiate individuals and families.[8] Membership in a particular odoodemong is determined by various factors, such as birth order, special achievements, or distinctive physical traits.[9]\n\nDespite the importance of the clan system in Anishinaabe culture, it has faced challenges and changes over time due to colonization, assimilation policies, and other external influences.[10] However, efforts have been made in recent years to revitalize and preserve this aspect of Anishinaabe heritage through education, cultural preservation programs, and traditional ceremonies like the Midewiwin (\"Grand Medicine Society\") initiation ceremony.\"[11]",

Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.\nThe European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home. The 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years.\nSimon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which covers the impact of technology on media",

This would enable households throughout Europe to enjoy crystal-clear pictures and sound quality while also gaining access to advanced features such as video recording capabilities built into set top boxes.\n\nIn addition to improving technical standards, the shift away from outdated technology promises significant economic benefits too. It could create thousands of jobs both directly through installation work but also indirectly via increased production activity related advertising revenue growth etc...\n\nHowever there remain concerns among some quarters about potential negative impact this transition might have particularly those living rural areas where reception may be poor due partly geographical factors.

I've always been a sucker for dinosaurs, and with the filming technology available today, a film like this one and it's predecessor have just the right ingredients for a fun time. Granted, there are many elements in the story here that don't make a whole lot of sense, but there's that old saying about suspending disbelief, so that's what I'm applying here.<br/><br/>Besides all the puzzling plot elements, and you know what most of them are, here's one I picked up in an early scene. When Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) looks at the wall map showing 'Las Cinco Muertes', The Five Deaths, the island of Isla Sorna is at the center of that cluster. In the opening screen narrative it's stated that this island is eighty seven miles southwest of Isla Nublar, but none of the other islands on the map go by that name. So a bit of a continuity slip-up there.<br/><br/>You know what I got a kick out of? At one point, one of the principal characters upon arriving on the island, states that the Eisenberg Uncertainty Principle is in effect, that is, it's not possible to study something without changing it. That was oddly reminiscent of the original Star Trek Prime Directive; an interesting concept but virtually impossible to maintain, because once you're there, your actions have consequences.<br/><br/>Say, and how about that Roland (Pete Postlethwaite), is he a Nascar contender or what? Recall when the InGen team first arrive on Isla Sorna and he's driving on the jungle trails with Ludlow (Arliss Howard). I had to rewind the scene because he had his head turned completely around to Ludlow in the back seat for a full forty seconds at one point - how did he do that? <br/><br/>Well anyway, not a lot of credibility to the picture, but how can you not marvel at the imaginative CGI work creating those magnificent dinosaurs? Stego's, T-Rex's and all those mini-predators make for a couple hours of dino fun. You don't even have to pay attention to the scientists.",

Sparse approximation is essential in many\ndisciplines, with new challenges emerging in online learning with kernels. To\nthis end, several sparsity measures have been proposed in the literature to\nquantify sparse dictionaries and constructing relevant ones, the most prolific\nones being the distance, the approximation, the coherence and the Babel\nmeasures. In this paper, we analyze sparse dictionaries based on these\nmeasures. By conducting an eigenvalue analysis, we show that these sparsity\nmeasures share many properties, including the linear independence condition and\ninducing a well-posed optimization problem. Furthermore, we prove that there\nexists a quasi-isometry between the parameter (i.e., dual) space and the\ndictionary's induced feature space.\n",

Overall, this work provides a valuable contribution towards understanding how best to leverage structured priors within nonparametric models like those based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) representations.",

And Blues boss Jose Mourinho backed Gerrard's view that Rafael Benitez's team could struggle to progress this season. \"Rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team, maybe he's a little bit behind (right now),\" he told BBC Radio Five Live.\nGerrard, who fired Liverpool into the last 16 of this season's competition with a brilliant goal in December's win over Olympiakos, insisted he was still fully focused on helping Liverpool to glory this season. The Reds are currently fifth in the Premiership table, five points off the crucial fourth spot, which brings Champions League qualification - and they face Chelsea in Sunday's Carling Cup final. \"It's big couple of months for Liverpool,\" he added. \"We're fighting for the fourth spot for the Champions League for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions, which are very important. \"We are confident we can upset Chelsea in the Carling Cup final and get to the last eight of the Champions League because, financially, it is big for the club and, personally for myself, it is very good.\"",

        "human_text": "This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful, timeless epic romances of all time, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Stunning cinematography combines here with a turbulent historical setting, an unforgettable idealistic hero, and one of the most compelling fictional love triangles of all time. This surely ranks among the best of director David Lean's many masterpieces. It is based on Boris Pasternak's novel, which I confess to not having read so cannot comment on the faithfulness of the film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the dreamy physician and poet, Yuri Zhivago, and his dramatic experiences during the tumult of the Russian Revolution. The story is told in flashback mode during later Communist years by Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, a Soviet Army officer, to the young woman, Tanya, who may be the long lost daughter of Yuri and his lover, Lara. As a sensitive young boy, Yuri's mother dies and he is adopted by a foster family, the Gromekos. Later reaching adulthood, he studies medicine and marries his childhood sweetheart, Tonya, and they have a little boy, Sasha. However, earlier at their engagement party, he has found himself strangely drawn to a beautiful & mysterious woman named Lara. Soon all their personal lives are thrown into turmoil by World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution.<br/><br/>The handsome Omar Sharif is brilliantly empathetic in the role of Zhivago, masterfully conveying his character's emotions. Who can forget his intensely expressive, tear filled eyes at some of the more emotional moments, especially with snowflakes melting on them? A physician but also a poet, Yuri has a deep appreciation of the beauty around him. His gentleness and idealism stand in sharp contrast to the horrific violence of war and revolution, as Yuri witnesses such atrocities as dismemberment and cannibalism. Also, this is a man who remains very much an individual despite the Bolshevik's philosophies of collectivism.<br/><br/>That era's devastating events unfold, including the Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent Civil War between the Tsarist Whites & the Communist Reds. However, the main conflict here is internal within Yuri's own heart, as he is torn between fidelity and passion. He deeply loves his sweet, gentle, and dependable wife, Tonya, and struggles to remain faithful. Yet he is tempted by a forbidden passion for the alluring Lara, a nurse at the wartime army hospital where both are caring for wounded soldiers. Lara serves as his muse, speaks to his soul, and is the inspiration for his poetry. Unlike most modern cinematic tales of infidelity which involve little restraint or guilt, Yuri and Lara desperately seek personal integrity as they are repeatedly brought together (and separated) by the upheaval of war and revolution. Surely if Yuri is 'the worst of sinners, then he is the worst of sufferers also'. <br/><br/>The two women in Yuri's life, wife and mistress, stand in sharp contrast, though both come across as sympathetic characters. The lovely Geraldine Chaplain portrays his ladylike, aristocratic wife, Tonya, who is well bred and has been schooled abroad. The daughter of the bourgeois Gromeko, she is actually Yuri's step sister, which might understandably tend to elicit more platonic than passionate feelings from her husband. Yuri and Lara succumb to their passions even as the blameless Tonya is pregnant with Yuri's second child. Tonya is a warm, loving wife and devoted mother, undeserving of her husband's infidelity. <br/><br/>Julie Christie plays the gorgeous & enigmatic Lara, a woman whose station in life makes her vulnerable to misuse by men, yet she possesses a genuine resourcefulness and inner strength. As a teenage girl, she is seduced and violated by the lecherous Victor Komarovsky, a despicable politician and her own mother's lover. She falls under repeated abuse by this vile & contemptible character, who calls Lara a slut and treats her as such. Later she is fiancé & then wife to the misguided idealist and activist, Pasha, who holds intense political ideologies which become more crucial than his wife to him. Pasha later becomes Strelnikov, the obsessive Bolshevik officer who eventually comes into confrontation with Zhivago. During much of the tumult, Lara entrusts her own & Pasha's daughter, Katya, into the care of others. Of course the legend of Lara lives on musically in Maurice Jarre's lovely, haunting Lara's Theme.<br/><br/>Supporting cast members include Rod Steiger, who is perfect as the villainous Komarovsky, and Tom Courtenay as Pasha / Strelnikov, a shy and pure individual who earns the abused Lara's respect and love, later going on to become a cold hearted revolutionary. Alec Guiness portrays Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, and Ralph Richardson is Tonya's aristocratic & gentlemanly father, Alexander Gromeko.<br/><br/>This film has amazing Oscar winning cinematography throughout. During World War I and the Revolution, there are vivid scenes of battle, mass desertion, and endless march through the desolate, blizzard ridden Siberian wasteland. Also visually stunning is the spectacular train ride Yuri and his family must make from Moscow to the Urals, site of the family dachau. However, surely most viewers' truly unforgettable pictures are the snowy white sleigh ride and the magnificent ice castle at Varykino. No other film can compare in its depiction of winter scenery. This sweeping panorama, the era's tumultuous political events, and the emotional portrait of one sensitive man's experience of them, create a visual masterpiece and a truly immortal screen saga.",

Julie Christie was equally impressive as Lara, her strength and resilience shining through even in the face of unimaginable adversity.

We propose an approach to tackle this problem by rewriting the\ncomputational graph of a neural network, in which swap-out and swap-in\noperations are inserted to temporarily store intermediate results on CPU\nmemory. In particular, we first revise the concept of a computational graph by\ndefining a concrete semantics for variables in a graph. We then formally show\nhow to derive swap-out and swap-in operations from an existing graph and\npresent rules to optimize the graph. To realize our approach, we developed a\nmodule in TensorFlow, named TFLMS. TFLMS is published as a pull request in the\nTensorFlow repository for contributing to the TensorFlow community. With TFLMS,\nwe were able to train ResNet-50 and 3DUnet with 4.7x and 2x larger batch size,\nrespectively. In particular, we were able to train 3DUNet using images of size\nof $192^3$ for image segmentation, which, without TFLMS, had been done only by\ndividing the images to smaller images, which affects the accuracy.",

By breaking down a single model into smaller sub-graphs, it enables efficient memory usage and parallel processing on modern hardware architectures. This approach allows users to train larger neural networks with higher accuracy while reducing training time significantly. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated via extensive experiments comparing various optimization techniques such as batch normalization, dropout regularization, weight decay, etc., showing that combining these methods leads to improved performance when using TFLMS. Overall, our work presents an innovative solution addressing one of the major challenges faced by deep learning practitioners today – scaling up their models without sacrificing accuracy or speed.",

Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.",

He recalled being criticized for showing emotion during matches, while Serena Williams was praised for her fierce competitiveness and assertiveness. Hewitt also pointed to the different ways in which male and female players are expected to conduct themselves off the court, saying that women are generally given more leeway when it comes to personal choices and lifestyle decisions.\n\nDespite these challenges, Hewitt remains optimistic about the future of men's tennis and believes that younger players like Kyrgios have the talent and determination to break down barriers and change perceptions. He hopes that by speaking out about career sexism, he can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all players, regardless of gender.",

This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.",
        "direct_prompt": "General Motors has announced that it is recalling nearly half a million vehicles in North America due to safety concerns. The recall affects several models, including the Chevrolet Cruze, Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac XTS.\n\nIn a statement, GM said that certain brake pistons may have been manufactured with incorrect dimensions, which could lead to reduced braking performance or complete failure. The company added that it had received reports of three accidents involving these brakes but thankfully there were no injuries reported.\n\nCustomers will be notified by mail and dealers will replace the faulty brake piston free of charge starting next month. In the meantime, owners are advised to continue using their vehicles normally but should contact their local dealership if they experience any issues related to the brakes.\n\nThis latest recall comes just months after General Motors recalled over 3 million vehicles worldwide for various defects, highlighting the importance of regular checks and maintenance to ensure roadworthiness.",

It's a complex issue with no easy answers, but let me share my thoughts on it. \n\nIn some ways, AI has brought incredible advancements to our society. From self-driving cars to medical diagnoses, AI is making our lives easier and safer. But at the same time, there are concerns about job displacement, privacy violations, and even potential harm caused by rogue algorithms.\n\nSo what do we do? Should we scrap all progress made in AI and go back to the drawing board? That seems extreme and impractical. Instead, we need to take steps towards responsible development and use of AI. This includes investing in education and training programs for workers who may be displaced by automation, implementing strong regulations around data collection and usage, and actively pursuing research into safe and accountable AI systems.\n\nUltimately, stopping AI altogether isn't the answer. Rather, it's up to us as individuals and as a society to ensure that these powerful technologies are used responsibly and ethically.

The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.\nShareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.\nMCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC's AT&T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.",
        "direct_prompt": "In a move that will reshape the telecommunications industry, Verizon Communications has agreed to acquire its rival MCI in a deal worth $6.7 billion. The acquisition is expected to be completed by early 2006 and would create the largest communications company in the world with revenues exceeding $100 billion annually.\n\nThe merger was announced on Monday after months of negotiations between the two companies. It comes at a time when traditional telephone companies are facing increased competition from cable operators and other rivals offering video, internet and phone services.\n\n\"This transaction combines the strengths of both companies and creates significant value for our shareholders,\" said Ivan Seidenberg, chairman and CEO of Verizon. \"It also positions us well for future growth opportunities.\"\n\nMCI, which stands for Micro-Wave Communication Inc., was founded in 1962 and was one of the first companies to offer long distance service via satellite. However, it struggled financially over the years and filed for bankruptcy protection twice before being acquired by WorldCom in 1998. After the collapse of WorldCom, MCI was bought by Bedrock Computer Services LLC but later sold back to private equity firms who have now decided to sell it to Verizon.\n\nAnalysts say that the combination of Verzion's wireline network and MCI's wireless capabilities could give them an edge over competitors like AT&T and Sprint Nextel Corp. In addition, they expect cost savings through consolidation of operations and elimination of redundancies.\n\nHowever, some consumer groups have expressed concerns about potential anti-competitive effects of the merger. They argue that fewer players in the market could lead to higher prices and reduced quality of service for consumers. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Department of Justice will review the proposed deal to determine if it violates any antitrust laws.\n\nOverall, the telecom industry is likely to see more mergers and acquisitions as companies seek scale and efficiency amid intense competition and rapid technological changes. This latest deal underscores the shifting landscape of the sector and signals further consolidation ahead.",

I loved the story, the characters, the setting, the dancing, and well  the music was phenomenal not one bad song in the whole soundtrack. It just shows that you don't have to spend a fortune to make a great film. Thank you to the cast and crew for making such a wonderful film which makes me smile like a Cheshire cat whenever I watch it.",

Could it possibly live up to my nostalgic memories of endless rewatches as a teenager? The answer is yes – and no. \n\nThe dancing remains some of the best part about the movie; seeing Patrick Swayze's Johnny Castle effortlessly glide across the floor with Jennifer Grey's Baby Houseman in their iconic lift scene never gets old. And while there are certainly cringeworthy moments (I'm looking at you, over-the-top performances by Jack Weston and Jerry Orbach), overall the acting holds up surprisingly well considering how long ago it was made.\n    \nHowever, upon closer examination certain plot points feel dated or even problematic today. For instance, the way Baby's father reacts when he finds out she's been working as a waitress instead of studying abroad feels overly harsh given her age and lack of responsibility towards paying off her own tuition fees. Additionally, some scenes involving Asian characters felt stereotypical despite good intentions behind them (e.g., Kangaroo Guy).\n   \nOverall though, if you're a fan of 80s movies then definitely check outthis gem!

It's typically served as a side dish or relish with rice-based meals such as string hoppers (idiyappam) or plain boiled rice. The recipe for Hithi Nimun varies slightly across different regions in Sri Lanka but generally includes ingredients like red onion, chili flakes, turmeric powder, mustard seeds, curry leaves, garlic, ginger and fenugreek seed paste. \n\nThe process begins by frying these ingredients together until they become fragrant before adding tamarind pulp and jaggery to balance out the flavors. Finally, thick coconut cream mixed with freshly squeezed lime juice gives it its unique tanginess that sets apart from other dishes. Some people also add maldive fish which give extra taste to this nimun.\n\nIt has gained popularity not only within country borders but among expatriates living abroad who crave authentic Sri Lankan cuisine.

Allow to rest, 5 to 10 minutes. The mixture may not bubble much but it should start to swell slightly. Add 2 1/2 cups of the all-purpose flour, the water and caraway seeds. Mix slowly at first and then on medium speed. Add 1/2 cup more of the all-purpose flour and the salt. The dough should come together and have a tacky but not too sticky consistency. Add more of the all-purpose flour, as needed, to get the dough where it just pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue mixing until the dough looks smooth, about 5 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Turn the oven off 3 minutes after reaching the temperature. Spray the inside of a bowl with nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the turned-off oven. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. After the dough rises, remove the bowl from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Punch the dough and transfer to a work space. Separate the dough into 13 pieces, about 3 ounces each, using a bench knife. Use both your hands to roll the dough into tight, uniform balls. Make sure there are no air pockets in the middle of your dough balls. Roll each ball into 7-inch cylinders using both hands and rolling from the middle out. Make sure the cylinders are even in length or your buns will be wonky. Keep whatever dough you are not immediately working with covered loosely with plastic. Line a 15-inch-long, or longer, sheet pan with parchment paper or cover well in nonstick spray. Place each dough cylinder side-by-side up the center of the sheet pan, leaving 1/2-inch space between each one. Cover the pan with plastic and allow to rise until the cylinders are touching, about 15 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap. Combine 1 tablespoon water with the egg white and brush this mixture in an even coat all over the dough. Allow the dough to rise, about 15 minutes. Bake the dough until the buns are nicely golden brown on top and 190 degrees F in the center, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, about 20 minutes total. Remove pan from oven and allow the buns to rest in the pan, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the buns in one piece (that's very important) to a cooling rack to prevent soggy-bottom buns and cool, about 30 minutes. Transfer the buns to a cutting surface. Slice down the center of each tube of dough using a serrated knife (this is the cool part). You will lose half a tube on each end, hence yielding only 12 buns and 2 awesome slices of rye bread that you will eat immediately. The place where the tubes meet is now the center of the bun. They should split naturally but you can use a serrated knife to help them, if you choose. Note:Alternatively, I've found it works very well if you place tubes in a pan with higher sides and Slice between the natural separation. As long as the buns were touching each other while baking, you should still get the \"bread wall effect\" and the buns will be more even. Now you have a beautiful bread wall that you can butter and toast. Wrap the buns in plastic or a re-sealable plastic bag until ready to use. Freeze the buns immediately if you will not be using them the same day. Yield: 12 buns and 2 slices.",

I mean is it suppose to be a horror movie at the local shopping mall? No, of course it is in a haunted house, were else would it be? As much as this movie drew on the horror standards, I found it refreshingly different from most horror movies. Part of what I want from a movie is something different, not more of the same, and I think in that respect, all things considered, this movie delivered.<br/><br/>While it did make use of the standards like jump scares, I really felt the suspense of this movie. I mean, at least for me, this movie was wound very tight. The suspense was ratcheted to the limit.<br/><br/>While I'm still not past Daniel Radcliffe's voice, I still hear Harry or Daniel, his face and body language were spot on, and greatly added to the tension of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, it is what it is, a suspenseful horror movie that gets the job done. This isn't a genre noted for 'Academy Award' performances. But as suspenseful horror movies go, I was very satisfied with this one, and thought they did have a new approach to an old genre.<br/><br/>Steve B",
        "direct_prompt": "I recently watched The Woman in Black and was thoroughly spooked by its eerie atmosphere, well-crafted plot twists, and stellar performances from Daniel Radcliffe and Ciarán Hinds. Set in 1940's England, the story follows Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), a young solicitor who is tasked with settling the estate of a deceased woman whose house has been plagued by supernatural occurrences. As he delves deeper into her tragic history, his own life becomes threatened by malevolent forces lurking within the walls of Eel Marsh House. Director James Watkins expertly builds tension throughout the film, creating a haunting experience that will leave you checking under your bed before going to sleep. Overall, The Woman in Black is a chilling horror flick that proves old school scares are still effective when executed properly.",

        "human_text": " Celie, the protagonist and narrator, is a poor, uneducated, fourteen-year-old black girl living in the South. She starts writing letters to God because her father, Alphonso, beats and rapes her. Alphonso has already impregnated Celie once. Celie gave birth to a girl, whom her father presumably killed in the woods. Celie has a second child, a boy, whom her father also abducts. Celie’s mother becomes ill and dies. Alphonso brings home a new wife, and continues to abuse Celie. Celie and her bright, pretty younger sister, Nettie, learn that a man known only as Mr. Johnson wants to marry Nettie. Mr. Johnson has a mistress named Shug Avery, a sultry lounge singer whose photograph fascinates Celie. Alphonso refuses to let Nettie marry, and instead offers Mr. Johnson Celie, \"an ugly woman,\" as his bride. Mr. Johnson eventually accepts the offer, forcing Celie into a difficult and joyless married life. Nettie runs away from Alphonso and takes refuge at Celie’s house. Mr. Johnson still desires Nettie, and when he advances on her, she flees. Never hearing from Nettie again, Celie assumes her dead. Mr. Johnson's sister Kate feels sorry for Celie, and tells her to fight back against Mr. Johnson rather than submit to his abuses. Harpo, Mr. Johnson's son, falls in love with a large, spunky girl named Sofia. Shug Avery comes to town to sing at a local bar, but Celie is not allowed to go see her. Sofia gets pregnant and marries Harpo. Celie is amazed by Sofia’s defiance in the face of Harpo’s and Mr. Johnson’s attempts to treat Sofia as an inferior. Harpo, kinder and gentler than his father, still assumes this means he is doing something wrong and under the advice of Mr. Johnson and a momentarily jealous Celie, attempts to beat Sofia into submission. However, he consistently fails, as Sofia is at least as strong and a more experienced brawler. Shug falls ill and Mr. Johnson takes her into his house. Shug is initially rude to Celie, but the two women become friends as Celie takes charge of nursing Shug. Celie finds herself infatuated with Shug and attracted to her sexually. Frustrated by Harpo’s consistent attempts to subordinate her, Sofia moves out, taking her children with her. Several months later, Harpo opens a juke joint where Shug sings nightly. Celie grows confused over her feelings toward Shug. Shug decides to stay when she learns that Mr. Johnson beats Celie when Shug is away. Shug and Celie’s relationship grows intimate, and Shug begins to ask Celie questions about sex. Sofia returns for a visit and promptly gets in a fight with Harpo’s new girlfriend, Squeak. In town one day, the mayor’s wife, Miss Millie, asks Sofia to work as her maid. Sofia replies with a sassy \"Hell no!\" When the mayor slaps Sofia for her \"insubordination\", Sofia returns the blow, knocking the mayor down, for which she is sent to jail. Squeak’s attempts to get Sofia released are futile. Sofia is sentenced to work for 12 years as the mayor’s maid, though she is eventually released from jail six months early. Despite her new marriage, Shug instigates a sexual relationship with Celie, and the two frequently share the same bed. One night Shug asks Celie about her sister and Celie tells her she assumes Nettie is dead because she'd promised to write Celie but never did. Shug helps Celie recover letters from Nettie that Mr. Johnson has been hiding from her for decades. Overcome with emotion, Celie reads the letters in order, wondering how to keep herself from killing Mr. Johnson. The letters indicate that Nettie befriended a missionary couple, Samuel and Corrine, and accompanied them to Africa to do ministry work. Samuel and Corrine have two adopted children, Olivia and Adam. Nettie and Corrine have become close friends, but Corrine, noticing that her adopted children resemble Nettie, wonders if Nettie and Samuel have a secret past. Increasingly suspicious, Corrine tries to limit Nettie’s role within her family. Nettie becomes disillusioned with her missionary experience, as she finds the Africans self-centered and obstinate. Corrine becomes ill with a fever. Nettie asks Samuel to tell her how he adopted Olivia and Adam. Based on Samuel’s story, Nettie realizes that the two children are actually Celie’s biological children (whom Alphonso, her stepfather, abducted), alive after all. Nettie also learns that Alphonso is actually only Nettie and Celie’s stepfather, not their biological father, who was a store owner whom white men lynched because they resented his success. Alphonso told Celie and Nettie he was their real father because he wanted to inherit the house and property that was once their mother’s. Nettie confesses to Samuel and Corrine that she is in fact their children’s biological aunt. The gravely ill Corrine refuses to believe Nettie. Later, Corrine dies, finally having accepted Nettie’s story and reconciled thereto just before her death. Meanwhile, Celie visits Alphonso, who confirms Nettie’s story, admitting that he is only the sisters' stepfather. Celie begins to lose some of her faith in God, but Shug tries to get her to reimagine God in her own way, rather than in the traditional image of the old, bearded white man. Celie moves to Tennessee and designs and sews tailored pants, turning her hobby into a business. She returns to her home to learn that Mr. Johnson has changed dramatically, becoming much more considerate and even helping her sew some of the clothing for her business. He proposes that they marry \"in the spirit as well as in the flesh,\" but she declines. She also finds out that Alphonso, her stepfather, has died. Celie inherits the land and moves back into the house. Around this time, Shug has fallen in love with Germaine, a 19-year-old flautist that is part of her blues band, and the news of this crushes Celie. Shug travels across the country and to Panama with Germaine, all the while writing postcards to Celie. Nevertheless, Celie pledges to love Shug even if Shug does not love her back. Meanwhile, Nettie and Samuel marry and prepare to return to America. Before they leave, Adam marries Tashi, an African girl. Following African tradition, Tashi undergoes the painful rituals of female circumcision and facial scarring. In solidarity, Adam undergoes the same facial scarring ritual. The end of the novel has Nettie, Samuel, Olivia, Adam, and Tashi arriving at Celie's house. Nettie and Celie embrace, having not seen each other for over 30 years. They introduce one another to their respective families as the novel ends.",

Share trading will begin on 15 December, the LSE said. For China's aviation authorities, the listing is part of the modernisation of its airline sector to cope with soaring demand for air travel. No further details of the share price or number of shares were given.\nThe LSE has been working hard to woo Chinese companies to choose London, rather than New York for their listings. It opened an Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong last month. \"We are delighted that Air China has chosen London for its listing outside China,\" said LSE chief executive Clara Furse. \"The London Stock Exchange offers ambitious Chinese companies access to the world's most international equity market combined with high regulatory and corporate governance standards,\" she said. A spokesman for the LSE said: \"We've been engaged with them (Air China) for about 18 months, two years now.\" As part of its pitch to bring listings to London, the LSE is thought to be highlighting the extra costs and red-tape imposed by new US laws passed since the Enron scandal, whilst stressing London's strong regulatory environment.\nGermany's Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder began a three-day visit to Beijing on Monday by signing a deal worth 1bn euros ($1.3bn; £690m) for Airbus to sell 23 new planes to Air China, the Deutsche Welle radio station reported. China's booming economy has created huge demand for air travel among middle-class Chinese, turning the country into a sales battleground between rival plane makers Airbus and Boeing. Air China's long-awaited flotation is part of a strategy to modernise a dozen state-owned carriers, which have been reorganised into three groups under Air China, China Southern and China Eastern. Merrill Lynch are sole bookrunners for Air China's flotation, which will take the form of a share placing with institutional investors in London, though retail investors may be able to buy Air China shares in Hong Kong. Air China's primary listing will be in Hong Kong, with a secondary listing in London. The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars. However, investors may be wary of Chinese stocks. The collapse last week of China Aviation Oil, the Singapore-listed arm of a Chinese jet fuel trader, has cast the spotlight on corporate governance shortcomings at Chinese firms.",
        "direct_prompt": "Air China, one of China's largest airlines, has announced plans to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in what could be one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) this year. The company is looking to raise around £750 million ($1 billion) through the sale of new stock.\n\nThe move comes as Air China seeks to expand its international presence and tap into Britain's deep capital markets. The airline will become the first Chinese carrier to list overseas since China Southern Airlines raised money in New York in 2007.\n\nAnalysts say that the IPO represents an important step for Air China as it looks to modernize its fleet and improve efficiency. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used to repay debt and fund expansion plans, including the purchase of new aircraft.\n\nHowever, some investors have expressed concerns about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the aviation industry, which could affect demand for air travel. Air China has said that it is closely monitoring the situation but remains confident in its long-term prospects.\n\nIf successful, the LSE listing would follow another high-profile IPO by a Chinese company earlier this month when online retailer JD.com raised $3.8 billion in the US. It also underscores growing interest among Chinese firms in tapping global financial markets amid increasing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.",

Below\nThe iron ice stung like a goad,\nSlashing the torn shoes from my feet,\nAnd all the air was bitter sleet.\nAnd all the land was cramped with snow,\nSteel-strong and fierce and glimmering wan,\nLike pale plains of obsidian.\n-- And yet I strove -- and I was fire\nAnd ice -- and fire and ice were one\nIn one vast hunger of desire.\nA dim desire, of pleasant places,\nAnd lush fields in the summer sun,\nAnd logs aflame, and walls, and faces,\n-- And wine, and old ambrosial talk,\nA golden ball in fountains dancing,\nAnd unforgotten hands. (Ah, God,\nI trod them down where I have trod,\nAnd they remain, and they remain,\nEtched in unutterable pain,\nLoved lips and faces now apart,\nThat once were closer than my heart --\nIn agony, in agony,\nAnd horribly a part of me. . . .\nFor Lethe is for no man set,\nAnd in Hell may no man forget.)\nAnd there were flowers, and jugs, bright-glancing,\nAnd old Italian swords -- and looks,\nA moment's glance of fire, of fire,\nSpiring, leaping, flaming higher,\nInto the intense, the cloudless blue,\nUntil two souls were one, and flame,\nAnd very flesh, and yet the same!\nAs if all springs were crushed anew\nInto one globed drop of dew!\nBut for the most I thought of heat,\nDesiring greatly. . . . Hot white sand\nThe lazy body lies at rest in,\nOr sun-dried, scented grass to nest in,\nAnd fires, innumerable fires,\nGreat fagots hurling golden gyres\nOf sparks far up, and the red heart\nIn sea-coals, crashing as they part\nTo tiny flares, and kindling snapping,\nBunched sticks that burst their string and wrapping\nAnd fall like jackstraws; green and blue\nThe evil flames of driftwood too,\nAnd heavy, sullen lumps of coke\nWith still, fierce heat and ugly smoke. . . .\n. . . And then the vision of his face,\nAnd theirs, all theirs, came like a sword,\nThrice, to the heart -- and as I fell\nI thought I saw a light before.\nI woke. My hands were blue and sore,\nTorn on the ice. I scarcely felt\nThe frozen sleet begin to melt\nUpon my face as I breathed deeper,\nBut lay there warmly, like a sleeper\nWho shifts his arm once, and moans low,\nAnd then sinks back to night. Slow, slow,\nAnd still as Death, came Sleep and Death\nAnd looked at me with quiet breath.\nUnbending figures, black and stark\nAgainst the intense deeps of the dark.\nTall and like trees. Like sweet and fire\nRest crept and crept along my veins,\nGently. And there were no more pains. . . .\nWas it not better so to lie?\nThe fight was done. Even gods tire\nOf fighting. . . . My way was the wrong.\nNow I should drift and drift along\nTo endless quiet, golden peace . . .\nAnd let the tortured body cease.\nAnd then a light winked like an eye.\n. . . And very many miles away\nA girl stood at a warm, lit door,\nHolding a lamp. Ray upon ray\nIt cloaked the snow with perfect light.\nAnd where she was there was no night\nNor could be, ever. God is sure,\nAnd in his hands are things secure.\nIt is not given me to trace\nThe lovely laughter of that face,\nLike a clear brook most full of light,\nOr olives swaying on a height,\nSo silver they have wings, almost;\nLike a great word once known and lost\nAnd meaning all things. Nor her voice\nA happy sound where larks rejoice,\nHer body, that great loveliness,\nThe tender fashion of her dress,\nI may not paint them.\nThese I see,\nBlazing through all eternity,\nA fire-winged sign, a glorious tree!\nShe stood there, and at once I knew\nThe bitter thing that I must do.\nThere could be no surrender now;\nThough Sleep and Death were whispering low.\nMy way was wrong. So. Would it mend\nIf I shrank back before the end?\nAnd sank to death and cowardice?\nNo, the last lees must be drained up,\nBase wine from an ignoble cup;\n(Yet not so base as sleek content\nWhen I had shrunk from punishment)\nThe wretched body strain anew!\nLife was a storm to wander through.\nI took the wrong way. Good and well,\nAt least my feet sought out not Hell!\nThough night were one consuming flame\nI must go on for my base aim,\nAnd so, perhaps, make evil grow\nTo something clean by agony . . .\nAnd reach that light upon the snow . . .\nAnd touch her dress at last . . .\nSo, so,\nI crawled. I could not speak or see\nSave dimly. The ice glared like fire,\nA long bright Hell of choking cold,\nAnd each vein was a tautened wire,\nThrobbing with torture -- and I crawled.\nMy hands were wounds.\nSo I attained\nThe second Hell. The snow was stained\nI thought, and shook my head at it\nHow red it was! Black tree-roots clutched\nAnd tore -- and soon the snow was smutched\nAnew; and I lurched babbling on,\nAnd then fell down to rest a bit,\nAnd came upon another Hell . . .\nLoose stones that ice made terrible,\nThat rolled and gashed men as they fell.\nI stumbled, slipped . . . and all was gone\nThat I had gained. Once more I lay\nBefore the long bright Hell of ice.\nAnd still the light was far away.\nThere was red mist before my eyes\nOr I could tell you how I went\nAcross the swaying firmament,\nA glittering torture of cold stars,\nAnd how I fought in Titan wars . . .\nAnd died . . . and lived again upon\nThe rack . . . and how the horses strain\nWhen their red task is nearly done. . . .\nI only know that there was Pain,\nInfinite and eternal Pain.\nAnd that I fell -- and rose again.\nSo she was walking in the road.\nAnd I stood upright like a man,\nOnce, and fell blind, and heard her cry . . .\nAnd then there came long agony.\nThere was no pain when I awoke,\nNo pain at all. Rest, like a goad,\nSpurred my eyes open -- and light broke\nUpon them like a million swords:\nAnd she was there. There are no words.\nHeaven is for a moment's span.\nAnd ever.\nSo I spoke and said,\n\"My honor stands up unbetrayed,\nAnd I have seen you.

Directed by Luc Besson, this film takes you on a thrilling ride through the seedy underbelly of Paris as Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a young girl seeking revenge against the men who murdered her family, teams up with Léon (Jean Reno), a retired hit man looking to make amends for his past sins. Together, they navigate dangerous territory filled with corrupt cops, ruthless gangsters, and double-crosses at every turn. \n\nWhat sets \"Léon: The Professional\" apart from other films in its genre is the depth and complexity of its characters. Each person feels fully realized, with their own motivations, desires, and flaws driving the narrative forward. Jean Reno delivers a captivating performance as Leon, balancing vulnerability and strength effortlessly. Natalie Portman shines in her role as Mathilda, bringing both ferocity and tenderness to the character's journey towards vengeance. Supporting actors Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello also leave lasting impressions with their memorable portrayals.\n\nThe pacing of the film is masterful, building tension throughout while still finding time for moments of levity and humanity. Additionally, the score by Eric Serra perfectly complements the moody atmosphere created by City of Lights setting. Overall,\" Léon: The Professional\" stands out as one of the greatest crime dramas ever made and should be experienced by anyone who loves great cinema. 10/10 would watch again.",

        "human_text": "Copy editing (also known as copyediting and manuscript editing) is the process of revising written material to improve readability and fitness, as well as ensuring that text is free of grammatical and factual errors. The Chicago Manual of Style states that manuscript editing encompasses \"simple mechanical corrections (mechanical editing) through sentence-level interventions (line, or stylistic, editing) to substantial remedial work on literary style and clarity, disorganized passages, baggy prose, muddled tables and figures, and the like (substantive editing)\". In the context of print publication, copy editing is done before typesetting and again before proofreading. Outside traditional book and journal publishing, the term copy editing is sometimes incorrectly referred to as proofreading, or the term copy editing sometimes includes additional tasks. Although copy editors are generally expected to make simple revisions to smooth awkward passages, they do not have a license to rewrite a text line by line, nor do they prepare material on an author's behalf. Creating original content to be published under another person's name is called ghostwriting. Furthermore, copy editors are expected to query structural and organizational problems, but they are not expected to fix these problems. In addition, copy editors do not normally engage in developmental editing, which includes helping an author develop an idea into a publishable manuscript, overhauling a rough draft, identifying gaps in subject coverage, devising strategies for more-effective communication of content, and creating features to enhance the final product and make it more competitive in the marketplace.",

It involves correcting errors in grammar, punctuation and spelling, as well as improving the flow of ideas and ensuring consistency throughout the text. Copy editors may also suggest changes to improve the overall structure or tone of a piece.[1] \n\nIn publishing and journalism, copy editors are responsible for ensuring that articles, books, and other written materials meet certain standards of quality before they are published. They work with writers to refine their drafts, fact-check information, and ensure that all sources are properly cited. In digital media, copy editors may also be involved in creating and maintaining websites, social media accounts, and other online content.[2]\n\nThe field of copy editing has evolved along with advances in technology. With the rise of electronic publishing, many copy editors now work on computer software such as Adobe InDesign or Microsoft Word,[3] using tools like style sheets and find/replace functions to streamline the editing process. Some copy editors specialize in particular fields, such as science or finance, requiring knowledge specific terminology[4].\n\nEffective copy editing requires attention to detail, strong communication skillsand an understanding of the audience and purpose of the writing. Copy editors must balance preserving the author's voice while making sure the final product meets editorial standards.\"[5]\n\nSee also\n Proofreading\n Desk editor\n Style guide\n Writing process\n\nReferences:\n[1] The Chicago Manual of Style Online.

She said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message. And it had to fight poverty, not just focus on political rights for elites.\nMs Khan highlighted detentions without trial, including those at the US camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems. \"What's a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war,\" she said. \"By using the language of war, human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war.\" Ms Khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world. \"The human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights,\" she said. That was accompanied by a crisis of governance, where the United Nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account.\nThe Amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism. \"Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups,\" she said. Ms Khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system. There needed to be a drive to use simpler language, talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes. Such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world, she said.\nThe human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments. Al-Qaeda, for example, was not going to be impressed by a traditional Amnesty letter writing campaign. More also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations. Amnesty International members voted in 2001 to extend the organisation's work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too. Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife. \"We would be an elitist bunch working for the elites, for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read,\" she said. Despite her concerns, Ms Khan dubbed herself a \"hope-monger\", saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.",

        "human_text": "Reverend Elam Stevenson was an American Methodist preacher, who ministered during the early 19th century in southern Tennessee. Elam Stevenson was born on September 24, 1787 in North Carolina. In 1805, Elam Stevenson married Lydia Catherine Payne. Lydia was born on August 16, 1787 in Burke County, North Carolina and is the daughter of William Payne and Catherine (Arnold) Payne. Stevenson was a well-respected Methodist minister and founded the Old Bee Spring Methodist Church in rural Bryson TN, where he and his wife are both buried. Elam and Lydia Stevenson lived nearly their entire lives in Bunker Hill, Tennessee. The 'White Frame' Bee Springs Church building (not original) still stands on the grounds and the spring still puts forth fresh cold water to be enjoyed by passers-by. Many ministers of the gospel, including four sons, have proceeded from the lineage of Rev. Stevenson. Reverend Elam Stevenson was of Scots-Irish descent, being the son of James Stevenson of Iredell, now Alexander County, North Carolina who was a Captain in the American Revolutionary War. Elam was the third son and the first of the family to join the Methodist Church. He professed religion in 1804 and joined the church in 1806. He was much opposed by his parents, who were Presbyterians (being of Scottish heritage), and they honestly thought he was being deceived by the false teachers who were to come in the last days. He was licensed to preach in 1813 and the same year moved to Giles County, Tennessee.",

In addition owning large tracts farmland across several states where crops like wheat were grown extensively (8).  He also invested heavily into transportation infrastructure projects; most notably helping finance construction transcontinental railroad lines connecting east coast westward expansion efforts via Union Pacific Railroad Company stock purchases early 1870s. This move would prove highly lucrative later decade once government subsidies started flowing towards these companies after passage Granger Acts 1873 allowing them charge higher rates shippers thus increasing profits significantly over time.)\n    \nDespite criticism from some quarters about how wealthy individuals acquired their money amidst growing income inequality concerns at turn 19th century, Elam remained committed giving back community throughout life both locally internationally. One notable example this generosity includes donation $100k establish University Southern Californiain 1880 under condition school bear name family member deceased daughter Minnie Lovina Haines whom passed away prematurely childbirth few years earlier aged just 23 yrs old)(9).

These include best film, best director and best actress shortlist for Imelda Staunton who plays the eponymous character. The film has spent months being lauded with prizes, from the Venice Film Festival to five awards from the London Critics' Circle on Wednesday night.\nThe Baftas has a tradition of honouring British cinema, and this year Vera Drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. Empire magazine's reviews editor Dan Jolin said the film had \"a very good chance\" of doing well on Saturday, predicting that it would collect five or six awards. \"I don't think it's going to do a Lord of the Rings-style sweep, but Imelda Staunton is a shoo-in for best actress,\" he said.\n\"A best director prize for Mike Leigh and best British film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors The Aviator and Finding Neverland.\" Mr Jolin tipped another contender - most likely The Aviator - to walk away with the Bafta for best film, and added that Finding Neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies. Strong Oscar contenders Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.\n\"There is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back. Out of all the films in the running for the Baftas, Vera Drake is the true blue British one.\"\n\"If Mike Leigh is going to win awards for anything, it should be Vera Drake at this year's Baftas\", said Mr Jolin, adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet. Mr Jolin also tipped Phil Davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in Vera Drake but felt that Heather Craney could be outdone by Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman in the supporting actress category. \"If there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the Baftas,\" he said.\nThe Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there \"might well be\" a sweep of awards for Vera Drake on Saturday night. \"I hope that Bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film. If Bafta can't do so, what hope is there?\" he said. Mr Bradshaw felt that Mike Leigh's \"masterpiece\" was entitled to the best film award - leaving Dead Man's Shoes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, My Summer of Love and Shaun of the Dead to slug it out for the best British film trophy. \"I will be cheering if Vera Drake wins a whole host of awards,\" he added.",

Coarse-grained\ncontraction mappings, system level stability analysis as well as acceleration\nof the direct simulation, are enabled through this computational multiscale\nenabling technology.\n",
        "direct_prompt": "This study presents a system-level numerical analysis of a Monte Carlo simulation model developed to investigate the chemotactic behavior of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in response to chemical gradients. The simulation employs stochastic processes and incorporates various parameters such as diffusion, run/tumble decision making, and chemoreceptor activation dynamics. By analyzing the results at the systems level, we gain insights into how these factors contribute to the overall chemotactic performance of E. coli cells. Our findings suggest that while individual behaviors may be random or noisy, their collective action leads to an efficient exploration strategy optimized for locating nutrient sources within complex environments. Overall, this work highlights the importance of using computational models coupled with systematic analyses to better understand biological phenomena like bacterial chemotaxis.",

One day, Martin Naumchik, a human male, is visiting the zoo when his personality and that of the biped are interchanged. The switch is the unintended consequence of an experiment in time travel that takes place at another location. The remainder of the story follows the two characters as they come to terms with their new bodies and new feelings. Martin quickly becomes aware of the degradation of being a zoo animal, while Fritz is forced to cope with life in a confusing and threatening alien society. Martin tries, and fails, to convince his captors that he is imprisoned in the biped's body; the biped, in Martin's body, eventually comes into contact with Martin's colleagues and his lover, and manages to continue with Martin's life. The novel also deals wryly with the theme of sexual identity. Because Fritz is provided with inguinal glands resembling a human male's, he is presumed to be male. But it turns out that the organ has nothing to do with reproduction: Fritz is a female, and the smaller primate with whom he shares a cage is a male. To reproduce, the female aggressively bites off an egglike knob from the male's forehead containing the semen. Martin (in Fritz's body), and the reader, only learn this at the end of the novel, when he is overcome by passion and commits the act.",

Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 2/3 cup Morton's kosher salt*\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup packed light brown sugar\n1 rindless pork belly (5 to 8 lbs. without rind)\n2 tablespoons molasses (not blackstrap)\n2 tablespoons cracked black pepper\nMix together salt (and curing salt, if using) and sugars in a bowl with your hands. \"That way you can break up the lumps in the brown sugar.\" Rinse pork belly, pat dry, and cut in half crosswise (with the grain). Rub pork halves all over with molasses. \"Get it into all the nooks and crannies. When it's nice and lathered up, sprinkle both sides with pepper.\" Follow the pepper with a generous sprinkling of salt-sugar mixture; depending on the size of your halves, you may have quite a bit left over. \"Massage it in gently all over and then give them a little shake\" to get rid of the excess. Put each half in a nonmetallic container with 2-in.-high sides, such as a Pyrex baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap. Chill pork halves 5 days to 1 week, depending on their weight. Turn them over every day. They will produce quite a bit of liquid, which you should leave in. \"You have to turn them religiously. That gets them to cure evenly.\" They will feel firmer than they did when raw and will be a deep rosy brown color (rosier if using curing salt). Rinse pork (it's okay if some pepper still sticks) and pat dry. \"Otherwise your bacon might be too salty.\" Meanwhile, stack 4 or 5 charcoal briquets and a couple of paraffin lighter cubes to one side in a chimney starter, ignite cubes, and let briquets burn until ashy and glowing, about 20 minutes. Set an 8- by 10-in. disposable aluminum roasting pan on one side of grill's firegrate. Arrange 4 or 5 wood chunks in pan in a single layer. With tongs, set the ashy briquets directly on chunks, spaced apart. When chunks begin to smolder, open bottom vents of grill and set cooking grate in place with hinged section over wood. Lay pork halves, fat side up, on cooking grate but not directly over wood. Set lid in place and fully open its vents. Your goal is to produce lots of billowing smoke. Keeping the heat between 150° and 200°, smoke pork 3 1/2 hours. Check the heat every 20 minutes or so. If it dips below 150°, add another chunk and/or ashy briquet to the pan. If it climbs above 200°, close top and bottom vents halfway, or remove a chunk or briquet. Chill smoked bacon, uncovered, 4 hours, then wrap well in plastic wrap and chill overnight. \"You want it to be not so pliable when you cut it.\" If the bacon's sides are uneven, \"whack them off and use them in soup or beans. At the restaurant, we dice them up and make bacon jam too. I put that on everything!\" Set a metal rack in a rimmed baking pan; repeat with a second pan and rack. Slice bacon with the grain about 1/2 in. thick, then lay slices on racks. Put pans in oven and turn to 425° (do not preheat oven). Roast bacon just until edges are crisp, about 30 minutes, rotating pans halfway through if necessary for even browning. \"I like to render it first so some of the fat drips out, but not so much that you get shrinkage.\" Bacon can be cooled at this point, then wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled for up to 2 days. To finish cooking, either grill it (as Lettau does at the restaurant), pan-fry it, or keep roasting until it's as crisp as you like. Lettau suggests not overcooking. \"I like the edges to be crisp but the rest juicy.\" *Diamond Crystal is more voluminous than Morton's, so you need to use more of it for equivalent saltiness. Make ahead: Smoked bacon (through step 9), up to 1 day, wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled; or up to 2 months, frozen. Rendered bacon slices (through step 12), up to 2 days, wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled. What about nitrite? Brad Lettau cures his bacon without sodium nitrite, a salt used commercially to ward off bacteria. (Sodium nitrate, also sometimes used, converts to nitrite in the body.) Bacon made without nitrite tastes porkier and is browner; nitrite is what adds that familiar \"bacon-y\" taste and rosy hue. Lettau's bacon is absolutely safe to make at home because it's roasted well. But if you're considering using sodium nitrite, here's what to know. In the 1970s, studies suggested it could be carcinogenic; however, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Medical Association have since concluded that, in the small amounts typically added to food, it isn't harmful. In fact, we get nitrite from vegetables (especially celery and spinach). If you opt to add sodium nitrite to Lettau's recipe, all that's required is 1 teaspoon of pink curing salt (a mix of 25 percent sodium nitrite and 75 percent salt) for every 5 pounds of meat, mixed in with the dry rub in step The bright pink color means you won't mistake it for table salt.

Our findings suggest that this approach has significant potential for applications involving network segmentation and community detection.",

In his travels to the Northlands, Arutha finds his father's former enemy, Guy du Bas-Tyra, as the Protector of the city Armengar, the first location to be invaded by the dark army under Murmandamus. In an attempt to destroy a majority of the army, Guy orders the evacuation of the city, and ignites the naphtha mines below the city. Unfortunately, Murmandamus escapes unscathed, and the army marches towards the border of the Kingdom of the Isles. Meanwhile Pug and Tomas begin searching the world, and eventually beyond, for the famed sorcerer Macros the Black, thought killed when he helped to destroy the rift (at the end of Magician). Macros reveals that he had put into motion a grand plot to instill Tomas with the powers of the Valheru, Ashen-Shugar, in order to turn the tides of the coming battle in their favour. Murmandamus, having successfully overrun the border city of Highcastle, marches towards his final objective: the town of Sethanon, which lies above an ancient ruins containing an artifact of power known as the Lifestone. Murmandamus lays siege to Sethanon, causing wholesale slaughter regardless of his own soldiers, in order to draw his necromantic power from their deaths. Steeped in power, he descends into the chamber of the Lifestone, and is confronted by Arutha, where they begin to duel. A rift begins to form within the chamber, held closed only by the magical efforts of Pug and Macros. Arutha manages to kill Murmandamus, revealing his true form as a Pantathian impersonating a moredhel. With his death, the escaped magical energy causes the rift to open briefly, releasing a Valheru, and a life-stealing Dreadlord. Tomas, now fully embracing his Valheru heritage, battles his ancient kin, while his dragon mount fights the Dreadlord. At the climax of the battle, Tomas stabs his sword through his enemy, and into the Lifestone, inadvertently releasing the spirits of all other Dragonlords. Their combined might, however, is no match for the Lifestone, the nexus of all life on Midkemia. They are drawn into the Lifestone and trapped for all eternity. The invasion is over. Afterwards, Macros entrusts the guardianship of the world to Pug and Tomas, saying that his task to protect Midkemia is finished, and disappears. fr:Ténèbres sur Sethanon nl:Duisternis over Sethanon pl:Mrok w Sethanon",

As they drew closer to their goal - the mythical fortress of Sethanon, where it was said the darkness originated from - they realized that the cost of victory would be high, and that the line between light and dark was often blurred.

        "human_text": "Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.\nThe poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: \"I can spend the same money twice.\" The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle but Labour insists it is simply anti-Tory. Labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: \"2+2=5\".\nThe hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the Dickens character Fagin in the stage version of the musical Oliver! There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members. It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs. Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday. Instead, he pointed to how Tony Blair had in 1997 complained about \"personalised abusive campaigning\". Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: \"It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches.\"\nJewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. \"Shylock and Fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. \"Whatever the idea is, I think it's a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning.\" Mr Temko said he blamed \"cock-up not conspiracy\", saying he did not detect inherent anti-Semitism in any of the parties' election campaigns.\nThe poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood. The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued. \"Concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but I would emphasise that if you see the posters, the common theme... is that the Tories are trying to con you.\" A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row. \"This has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss,\" he said. But a Conservative spokeswoman said: \"This poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by Labour's campaign team.\"",

He gets a ride to his destination on a ship piloted by some of the characters of The Land of Crimson Clouds. When the novel starts Yurkovsky and Grisha Bykov - Bykov's son - and Dauge say goodbye to Bykov senior and leave on a mission from international spaceport Mirza-Charle. Meanwhile, Yuri Borodin is also in the spaceport, trying to find a ride. Spaceport authorities direct him to the port director, but he is currently out of town. Disappointed Yuri wanders into a Capitalist-run bar, where the owner-cum-bartender is engaged in an ideological debate with a Russian Communist. Yuri befriends the Russian, Ivan Zhilin, and tells him of his problems. Ivan suggests Yuri to go to the spaceport hotel in the evening, and try to convince the astronauts who stay there to take him along. Yuri does so and meets Bykov and Yurkovsky. Yurkovsky, currently serves as a Chief Inspector. He plans to make a tour of several planets and planetoids. Bykov is piloting his ship. They agree to give Yuri a ride. Their first stop is Mars. The Russian colonists there are battling an alien life form the giant slug. As the colonists are planning a large-scale slug hunt, they realize that some of the buildings in the area are not human-made. Since the buildings look so much like the simple prefabricated structures set up by the colonists, everyone just assumed they were left there by previous expeditions. Some colonists lament the lack of initiative that has descended over the colony in recent years, and Yurkovsky agrees. The raid on slugs, carried out in part using the weapons brought by Yurkovsky, is reasonably successful, and the colonists cheer up. On the way to research station Einomia, the spaceship crew runs an emergency drill, and Yuri, while stressed and confused, holds up to the pressure. A lot of physicists want to work on Einomia due to the unique research opportunities that it provides. The station is severely overcrowded but the scientists gladly put up with the inconveniences such as food shortages or having to sleep in an elevator. Yurkovsky disapproves, but gives a part of his own food supply to the hungry physicists. He says that such scientists should be a role model for Yuri. Planetoid Bamberga has deposits of precious space pearls. Capitalists run a mine on Bamberga. In the drive to maximize profits the miners work more than six-hours a day despite health risks due to high levels of radiation in the mine. This causes illness and premature death. The local safety-inspector, a Hungarian Communist, protests. But he is ignored and harassed. After his arrival, Yurkovsky arrests the mine's director and tells the workers to elect a replacement. The miners emphatically protest. Despaired, Yurkovsky leaves the meeting with the miners. However, one of the miners returns the string of space pearls that Yurkovsky accidentally left behind. The returned pearls are worth a large sum of money and Yurkovsky thinks that there is still hope for the miners. Back on the spaceship, Yuri and Zhilin watch an action film about the heroes of space exploration, and the young Yuri becomes excited. Zhilin explains the movie overly simplifies the picture and the life is much more complicated and a lot less glamorous than how it is portrayed. He alludes to the events in The Land of Crimson Clouds. The next stop of the tour is Diona space observatory; the researchers there produce valuable scientific contributions. However, personal relationships deteriorate. Yuri gets into a fight with one of the young researchers. It turns out that two of the senior scientists were spreading rumors about the others to further their scientific careers. Yurkovsky orders them back to Earth and even suggests one of them to kill himself. He says that these two men managed to deceive the rest of the crew so successfully because many people in Communist society are not accustomed to others blatantly lying to them, and they are too proud to try to figure out the truth for themselves. Yurkovksy spaceship approaches Saturn and stops at Ring One space station. From there, Yuri is supposed to go to Ring Two: his worksite. Yurkovksy is getting too old for space travel. In all likelihood, this trip is the last of his space flights. He did a lot of research on the rings of Saturn and now he wants to see them close. The same is true for his navigator: Krutikov. Yurkovsky and Krutikov take a rocket to fly near the rings. As they approach the rings, Yurkovsky notices an unusual rock formation, and urges Krutikov to fly closer, despite the danger of a meteorite collision. Bykov orders them, over the radio, to stop. Yet, anxious to find out more about the discovery, Yurkovsky attacks Krutikov and breaks the radio. Krutikov yields and descends to the rock formation. Bykov is speeding toward them on a spaceship that is supposed to leave for Ring Two space station. Yuri is on board. The rocket of Yurkovsky and Krutikov gets hit but a meteorite and they die. Yuri is injured and hospitalized.. He ponders how people will think of the new discovery as very important, but they will not remember the people who made it; he wishes that no discovery were made and the two people were still alive. Bykov and Zhilin return to Earth and meet a sick Dauge. He tells Bykov that a new expedition to planet Transpluton, also known as Cerberus, is planned, and he is offered to lead it. Bykov agrees apathetically. Zhilin, however, thinks that he would prefer to stay on Earth, because \"that is what is most important shall always remain on Earth.\"",

        "human_text": "Sri Lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.\nPresident Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka's economic growth this year. It estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.\nSeparately, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Indonesia alone. It called for action to create jobs. President Kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of Hambantota. She was joined by government and opposition politicians, together with Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian clergy.\nPrime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be \"the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation\". \"We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. Instead we have been squabbling, fighting,\" she added. Norway's peace negotiator Erik Solheim is due to arrive on Wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, who want a separate state in the north east of the country. Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri Lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.\nThe IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. \"The broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage,\" the IMF said. Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. \"The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,\" the report said. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. Inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. Although major exports have not suffered, the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as \"Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level\" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka's request for a freeze on loan repayments.",
        "direct_prompt": "Sri Lanka, an island nation in South Asia, has been facing significant economic challenges since the devastating tsunami that struck in 2004. The disaster caused widespread destruction and loss of life, leading to billions of dollars worth of damage. While the country has made strides in rebuilding and recovering over the past decade, the aftermath of the tsunami continues to have a lasting impact on its economy.\n\nAccording to recent reports, the tsunami slowed down Sri Lanka's growth significantly. In fact, experts estimate that it set back the country's development by at least five years. Small businesses were particularly hard-hit as many lost their livelihoods when their shops and homes were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Tourism also suffered greatly due to fears about visiting such a vulnerable location.\n\nDespite these obstacles, however, there are signs of hope for this beautiful island nation. Recent data shows that tourism is slowly picking up again after several difficult years. Additionally, government officials and private sector leaders have worked together to implement policies aimed at diversifying the economy away from reliance on agriculture towards manufacturing and other industries. This could help create more job opportunities while reducing vulnerability to natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes.\n\nOverall, though progress may be slow, analysts believethat with continued efforts toward recoveryand reconstruction, Sri Lankacould still achieveits potentialas oneofSouthAsia's mostpromisingeconomies. It will take time and dedication but ultimately,with perseverance and determination,this resilientnationcould bounceback strongerthan ever before.",

        "human_text": "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
        "direct_prompt": "The Labour Party has moved quickly to address concerns over an ongoing leadership contest, seeking to reassure voters that any signs of infighting are purely superficial and do not reflect deeper divisions within the party. In recent weeks, speculation about tensions between different factionshas grown, with some suggestingthat the campaign trail had become marred by personal attacksand backroom deals. However, in interviews conducted yesterday evening, senior figures from both camps insisted that they were united in their commitment to securing victory at the next general election, regardless of who ultimately emerges as leader. They also stressed the importance of maintaining unity if the party is to haveany hopeof ousting Prime Minister Boris Johnsonfrom Downing Street. While acknowledging that there may be occasional disagreements among colleagues, all those spoken to emphasised the need for solidarityin these challenging times,with one pointing out that\"we'reall in this together.\"",

Well befal\nThis day, whereon I see thee nigh,\nO Lancelot, before I die!\nAnd surely shall my heart rejoice\nSir Gawain, when I hear thy voice!\"\nThen Lancelot laughed: \"Thou knowest us then\nFull well among a many men?\"\n\"As quoth the lion to the mouse,\"\nThe man said; \"in King Arthur's House\nMen are not names of men alone,\nBut coffers rather of deeds done.\"\nThe Queen smiled blithe of heart, and spake:\n\"Hast thou done deeds for ladies' sake?\"\n\"Nay Dame,\" he said, \"I am but young;\nA little have I lived and sung\nAnd seen thy face this happy noon.\"\nThe King said: \"May we hearken soon\nSome merry tale of thee? for I\nAm skilled to know men low and high\nAnd deem thee neither churl nor fool.\"\nSaid he, \"My fathers went to school\nWhere folk are taught a many things,\nBut not by bliss: men called them kings\nIn days when kings were near to seek;\nBut as a long thread waxeth weak,\nSo is it with our house; and now\nI wend me home from oaken bough\nUnto a stead where roof and wall\nShall not have over far to fall\nWhen their last day comes.\"\nAs he spake\nHe reddened: \"Nathless for their sake,\nWhom the world loved once, mock not me\nO King, if thence I bring to thee\nA morsel and a draught of wine,\nThough nothing king-like here thou dine.\"\nOf some kind word King Arthur thought,\nBut ere he spake the woodman caught\nHis forest-nag and leapt thereon,\nAnd through the tangled brake was gone.\nThen leapt the King down, glad at heart,\nThinking, This day shall not depart\nWithout some voice from days that were;\nAnd lightly leapt down Guenevere,\nAnd man and maid lay presently\nNeath the bee-laden branches high,\nAnd sweet the scent of trodden grass\nAmid the blossoms' perfume was.\nThere long they lay, and little spake,\nAs folk right loth the calm to break;\nTill lo upon the forest-breeze\nA noise of folk, and from the trees\nThey came: the first-seen forester,\nA grizzled carle in such-like gear,\nAnd then two maidens poorly clad\nThough each a silver chaplet had\nAnd round her neck a golden chain:\nAnd last two varlets led a wain\nDrawn by white oxen well bedight\nWith oaken boughs and lilies white;\nTherein there lay a cask of wine\nAnd baskets piled with bread full fine,\nAnd flesh of hart and roe and hare;\nAnd in the midst upon a chair\nDone over with a cloth of gold\nThere sat a man exceeding old\nWith long white locks: and clad was he\nNo other than his company\nSave that a golden crown he bore\nFull fairly fashioned as of yore,\nAnd with a sword was girt about\nSuch as few folk will see I doubt.\nRight great it was: the scabbard thin\nWas fashioned of a serpent's skin,\nIn every scale a stone of worth;\nOf tooth of sea-lion of the north\nThe cross was, and the blood-boot stone\nThat heals the hurt the blade hath done\nHung down therefrom in silken purse:\nThe ruddy kin of Niblung's curse\nO'er tresses of a sea-wife's hair\nWas wrapped about the handle fair;\nAnd last a marvellous sapphire stone\nAmidst of the great pommel shone,\nA blue flame in the forest green.\nAnd Arthur deemed he ne'er had seen\nSo fair a sword: nay not when he\nThe wonder of the land-locked sea\nDrew from the stone that Christmas-tide.\nNow forth the forest youth did ride,\nLeapt down beside the King, and spake:\n\"King Arthur for thy greatness' sake\nMy grandsire comes to look on thee;\nMy father standeth here by me;\nThese maidens are my sisters twain;\nMy brethren draw out from the wain\nSomewhat thy woodland cheer to mend.\"\nThereat his sire the knee did bend\nBefore the King, who o'er the brown\nRough sleeve of the man's homespun gown\nBeheld a goodly golden ring:\nAnd fell to greater marvelling\nWhen he beheld how fine and fair\nThe woodman's kneeling sisters were.\nAnd all folk thereby deemed in sooth\nThat (save indeed the first seen youth)\nThese folk were nobler e'en than those\nOf Arthur's wonder of a house.\nBut now the elder drew anigh,\nBy half a head was he more high\nThan Arthur or than Lancelot,\nNor had eld bent him: he kneeled not\nBefore the King, but smiling took\nHis hands in hands that nowise shook;\nAnd the King joyed as he who sees\nOne of his fathers' images\nStand glad before him in a dream.\nThen down beside the bubbling stream\nThey sat together, and the King\nWas loth to fall a questioning;\nSo first the elder spake and said:\n\"It joys me of thy goodlihead\nO great king of our land; and though\nOur blood within thee doth not flow,\nAnd I who was a king of yore\nMay scarcely kneel thy feet before,\nYet do I deem thy right the best\nOf all the kings who rule the West.\nI love thy name and fame: behold,\nKing Arthur, I am grown so old\nIn guilelessness, the Gods have sent,\nBe I content or uncontent,\nThis gift unto my latter days\nThat I may see as through a haze\nThe lives and deeds of days to come:\nI laugh for some, I weep for some --\nI neither laugh nor weep for thee,\nBut trembling through the clouds I see\nThy life and glory to the end;\nAnd how the sweet and bitter blend\nWithin the cup that thou must drink.\nGood is it that thou shalt not shrink\nFrom either: that the afterdays\nShall still win glory from thy praise\nAnd scarce believe thee laid asleep\nWhen o'er thy deeds the days lie deep.\"\nHe ceased but his old lips moved still,\nAs though they would the tale fulfil\nHis heart kept secret: Arthur's eyes\nGleamed with the pride that needs would rise\nUp from his heart, and low he said:\n\"I know the living by the dead\nI know the future by the past.\"\nWise eyes and kind the elder cast\nUpon him; while a nameless fear\nSmote to the heart of Guenevere,\nAnd, fainting there, was turned to love:\nAnd thence a nameless pain did move\nThe noble heart of Lancelot,\nThe store of longing unforgot.\n-- And west a little moved the sun\nAnd noon began, and noon was done.\nBut as the elder's grey eyes turned\nOn Guenevere's, her sweet face burned\nWith sweet shame; as though she knew\nHe read her story through and through.\nKindly he looked on her and said:\n\"O Queen, the chief of goodlihead,\nBe blithe and glad this day at least\nWhen in my fathers' house ye feast:\nFor surely in their ancient hall\nYe sit now: look, there went the wall\nWhere yon turf ridge runs west-away:\nTime was I heard my grand-dame say\nShe saw this stream run bubbling down\nThe hall-floor shut in trench of stone;\nTherein she washed her father's cup\nThat last eve e'er the fire went up\nO'er ridge and rafter and she passed\nBetwixt the foeman's spears the last\nOf all the women, wrapping round\nThis sword the gift of Odin's ground.\"\nHe shook the weapon o'er his knee,\nThereon gazed Arthur eagerly.\n\"Draw it, my lord,\" quoth Guenevere,\n\"Of such things have we little fear\nIn Arthur's house.\" And Lancelot rose\nTo look upon the treasure close.\nBut grimly smiled the ancient man:\n\"E'en as the sun arising wan\nIn the black sky when Heimdall's horn\nScreams out and the last day is born,\nThis blade to eyes of men shall be\nOn that dread day I shall not see --\"\nFierce was his old face for a while:\nBut once again he 'gan to smile\nAnd took the Queen's slim lily hand\nAnd set it on the deadly brand\nThen laughed and said: \"Hold this, O Queen,\nThine hand is where God's hands have been,\nFor this is Tyrfing: who knows when\nHis blade was forged? Belike ere men\nHad dwelling on the middle-earth.\nAt least a man's life is it worth\nTo draw it out once: so behold\nThese peace-strings wrought of pearl and gold\nThe scabbard to the cross that bind\nLest a rash hand and heart made blind\nShould draw it forth unwittingly.\"\nBlithe laughed King Arthur: \"Sir,\" said he,\n\"We well may deem in days by gone\nThis sword, the blade of such an one\nAs thou hast been, would seldom slide\nBack to its sheath unsatisfied.\nLo now how fair a feast thy kin\nHave dight for us and might we win\nSome tale of thee in Tyrfing's praise,\nSome deed he wrought in greener days,\nThis were a blithesome hour indeed.\"\n\"Sir,\" said the elder, \"little need\nTo pray me hereof. Please ye dine\nAnd drink a cup of woodman's wine,\nSurely meantime some tale shall stir\nWithin my heart of days that were.\"\nThen to their meat they gat and there\nFeasted amid the woodland fair\nThe fairest folk of all the land.\nAh me when first the Queen's fair hand\nDrew near the kneeling forest youth\nNew-wrought the whole world seemed in sooth\nAnd nothing left therein of ill.\nSo at the last the Queen did fill\nA cup of wine, and drank and said:\n\"In memory of thy fathers dead\nI drink, fair lord, drink now with me\nAnd then bethink thee presently\nOf deeds that once won prize and praise\nThe glory of thy fathers' days.\"\nHe drank and laughed and said,\" Nay, nay,\nKeep we the peace-strings whole today.\nThis draught from where thy lips have been\nWithin mine old heart maketh green\nThe memory of a love full true,\nThe first recorded deed that drew\nMy fathers' house from dark to light.\nIf thus my grandame told aright,\nA rougher place our land was then,\nQuoth she, than with us living men,\nAnd other trees were in the wood\nAnd folk of somewhat other blood\nThan ours: then were the small-eyed bears\nMore plenty in the woodland lairs\nThan badgers now: no holiday\nIt was to chase the wolves away,\nYea there were folk who had to tell\nOf lyngworms lying on the fell,\nAnd fearful things by lake and fen,\nAnd manlike shapes that were not men.\nThen fay-folk roamed the woods at noon,\nAnd on the grave-mound in the moon\nFaint gleamed the flickering treasure-flame.\nDays of the world that won no fame,\nYet now, quoth she, folk looking back\nAcross the tumult and the wrack\nAnd swelling up of windy lies\nAnd dull fool-fashioned cruelties,\nDeem that in those days God abode\nOn earth and shared ill times and good\nAnd right and wrong with that same folk\nTheir hands had fashioned for the yoke.\nQuoth she, of such nought tells my tale,\nYet saith that such as should prevail\nIn those days o'er the fears of earth\nMust needs have been some deal of worth,\nAnd saith that had ye seen a kin\nWho dwelt these very woods within\nThem at the least ye would have told\nFor cousins of the Gods of old.\nAmongst all these it tells of one,\nThe goodman's last-begotten son,\nSome twenty summers old: as fair\nAs any flower that blossomed there\nIn sun and rain, and strong therewith\nAnd lissom as a willow withe.\nNow through these woods amidst of June\nThis youngling went until at noon\nFrom out of the thicket his fair face\nPeered forth upon this very place;\nFor he had been a-hunting nigh\nAnd wearied thought a while to lie\nBeside the freshness of the stream.\nBut lo as in a morning dream\nThe place was changed, for there was dight\nA fair pavilion blue and white\nE'en where we play, and all around\nWas talk of men and diverse sound,\nTinkling of bit and neigh of steed\nClashing of arms and iron weed.\nFor round about the painted tent\nArmed folk a many came or went,\nOr on the fresh grass lay about.\nSurely our youth at first had doubt\nIf 'twere not better to be gone\nThan meet these stranger folk alone --\nBut wot ye well such things as these\nWere new to him born mid the trees\nAnd wild things: and he thought, Maybe\nThe household of the Gods I see:\nWho for as many tales as I\nHave heard of them, I ne'er saw nigh.\nIf they be men, I wotted not\nThat such fair raiment men had got;\nThey will be glad to show them then.\nFor one thing taught these woodland men\nWhatever wisdom they let fall\nMen since have won Fear nought at all.\nSo from the holly brake he strode\nShouldering the while his hunter's load,\nA new slain roe; but there arose\nTo meet him half a score of those\nWhom in fair words he greeted well.\nNow was he clad in a sheep's fell\nAnd at his back his quiver hung,\nHis woodknife on his thigh: unstrung\nHis bow he held in a staff's stead.\nAn oaken wreath was round his head\nFrom whence his crispy locks of brown\nWell nigh unto his belt hung down,\nAnd howso frank his eyes might be\nA half-frown soothly might you see\nAs these men handled sword or spear\nAnd cried out, \"Hold, what dost thou here?\"\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"then no Gods ye are.\nFear not, I shall not make you war.\"\nTherewith his hunting-knife he drew\nAnd the long blade before them he threw.\nThen loud they laughed; one sheathed his sword:\n\"Thanks, army-leader, for that word!\nWe are not Gods e'en as thou say'st,\nNor thou a devil of the waste\nBut e'en a devil's a friend belike.\"\nSomething [of] hate hereat did strike\nUnto the woodsman's unused heart,\nYet he spake softly for his part:\n\"What men are ye and where dwell ye?\nWhat is the wondrous house I see?\"\n\"In the fair southland is our home\nYet from the north as now we come,\"\nSaid one: then with a mocking smile,\n\"And in our house there dwells awhile\nA very Goddess of the north.\nBut lo you, take a thing of worth\nFor that thy quarry, and begone.\"\nBut as he spake another one\nSpake softly in his ear: and so\nThe word from this to that did go,\nWith laughing that seemed nowise good\nUnto the dweller of the wood,\nWho saying nought moved toward the tent.\nBut they came round him as he went\nAnd said: \"Nay, pagan, stay thy feet;\nThou art not one our dame to greet\n. . .",

I’ve yet to show anybody because they’re a sensitive topic to me , but I just wanna know - are they something I should let control my life the way I do?

        "human_text": "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
        "direct_prompt": "\"If you're looking to be entertained by over-the-top violence, crude language and steamy sex scenes, then Scarface is definitely the film for you. The acting was decent overall, with Al Pacino giving a convincing performance as Tony Montana. However, some may find the excessive profanity and graphic imagery to be unnecessary or even offensive. Overall, if you can look past these flaws, there's still plenty of entertainment value in this classic gangster flick.\"",

Inaugurated in 1991, the World Cup began as an attempt to create a regular season under its management in tandem with the ITU Triathlon World Championship race. However, this meant that there was a World Cup champion as well as a world champion. Following the 2008 series the ITU reorganized its top level competitions and created the World Triathlon Series, a series of races that was to be the successor of the World Championship. Meanwhile, the World Cup was relegated to become a second tier series, as a result the number of races in the World Cup were reduced. Since the reformat, points earned in World Cup racing are now applied only to an athlete's World Ranking. Points\nAt its founding the first twenty athletes each race would earn points dependent on their placing and the athletes with the most points at the end of the season would be named the World cup champion.

        "direct_prompt": "The World Triathlon Cup is an annual international triathlon competition organized by the International Triathlon Union (ITU). The event features national teams from various countries competing against each other in a relay format. Each team consists of three athletes, with one athlete completing each leg of the race: swimming, cycling, and running.\n\nThe first edition of the World Triathlon Cup was held in 1989, and since then it has become one of the most prestigious events in the sport of triathlon. It serves as a platform for elite triathletes to represent their country and compete at the highest level. In addition to providing competitive opportunities for top-level athletes, the World Triathlon Cup also promotes the development of the sport on a global scale through its participation in emerging markets.\n\nThroughout the years, the World Triathlon Cup has visited different cities around the world, showcasing beautiful landscapes and cultural heritage sites while promoting healthy lifestyles among locals. Some notable host cities include Edmonton, Canada; Chengdu, China; and Madrid, Spain. \n\nEach year, the ITU selects a venue that best represents the spirit of the tournament – combining sports excellence with local culture and traditions. This selection process ensures not only high-quality athletic performances but also provides spectators with memorable experiences both inside and outside the stadium.\n\nIn recent editions of the cup, Great Britain emerged as the dominant force winning six out of ten titles contested between 2010 - 2019. Other nations such as Germany or Australia have been consistently challenging them during this period. However individual races are always unpredictable due to nature of relays where any small mistake can cost dearly leading up till final sprint finish line which makes these competitions even more exciting watch.[1]\n   \nOverall, the World Triathlon Cup remains one of the most thrilling sporting events worldwide thanks to its unique blend of nationalism, camaraderie amongst competitors representing diverse cultures & skill levels combined together under single banner called'sportsmanship'.",

        "human_text": "Manchester United's board has agreed to give US tycoon Malcolm Glazer access to its books.\nEarlier this month, Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club. In a statement, the club said it would allow Mr Glazer \"limited due diligence\" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid. But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazer's plans, calling his assumptions \"aggressive\" and his plan \"damaging\". Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer. About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago.\nRival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday.\nManchester United's response comes as little surprise, as the board made clear. \"Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal,\" the club said in its statement. Should it become a firm offer, it should be at a price that \"the board is likely to regard as fair\" and on terms which \"may be deliverable\". But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer's proposal. \"The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer's business plan assumptions are aggressive,\" the statement said, \"and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.\" Whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms, in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them Manchester United's second biggest shareholders. They own the successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team based in Florida. If the family makes a formal offer, they will need the support of the club's biggest shareholders.\nIrish horse racing millionaires JP McManus and John Magnier own 29% of United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression, and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.\nA group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds. They have signed a House of Commons motion, and Tony Lloyd, the Manchester Central MP, whose constituency includes the club's Old Trafford ground, has pledged to take the matter \"to Tony Blair if necessary\". The Commons motion says \"any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football\". However, the DTI has dismissed the proposal. A spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. Mr Glazer's offer values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). Pitched at 300p per share, it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon, which was rejected out of hand. Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday, down 3.75p on the day.",
        "direct_prompt": "Manchester United has announced that it will allow its shareholders to scrutinize the club's finances, in an effort to address concerns over the ownership structure and debt levels at Old Trafford. The move comes amid growing pressure from fans and investors who have raised questions about the influence of the Glazer family, which took control of the club in 2005.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Manchester United said it would hold a special general meeting (SGM) later this month, where shareholders will be able to ask questions and review the club's accounts. This is believed to be the first time since the takeover that such detailed financial information will be made available to ordinary supporters.\n\nThe decision follows months of campaigning by activist groups like the Red Knights, who have called for greater transparency and accountability at the club. They argue that the current setup allows the Glazers to siphon off profits while saddling the team with high levels of debt, hindering its ability to compete on the pitch.\n\nHowever, the Glazer family has defended its record as owners, pointing to significant investment in recent years and the continued success of the men's and women's teams. In response to the planned SGM, a spokesperson told reporters: \"We welcome any opportunity to engage directly with our shareholders and are confident that we will continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model.\"\n\nDespite the ongoing controversy surrounding their ownership, Manchester United remains one of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, with an estimated worth of around $4 billion. However, unless changes are made to alleviate shareholder concerns, the club could face further unrest both on and off the field.",

But if indeed do feel\nThe nature of mind and energy of soul,\nAfter their severance from this body of ours,\nYet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds\nAnd wedlock of the soul and body live,\nThrough which we're fashioned to a single state.\nAnd, even if time collected after death\nThe matter of our frames and set it all\nAgain in place as now, and if again\nTo us the light of life were given, O yet\nThat process too would not concern us aught,\nWhen once the self-succession of our sense\nHas been asunder broken. And now and here,\nLittle enough we're busied with the selves\nWe were aforetime, nor, concerning them,\nSuffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze\nBackwards across all yesterdays of time\nThe immeasurable, thinking how manifold\nThe motions of matter are, then couldst thou well\nCredit this too: often these very seeds\n(From which we are to-day) of old were set\nIn the same order as they are to-day-\nYet this we can't to consciousness recall\nThrough the remembering mind. For there hath been\nAn interposed pause of life, and wide\nHave all the motions wandered everywhere\nFrom these our senses. For if woe and ail\nPerchance are toward, then the man to whom\nThe bane can happen must himself be there\nAt that same time. But death precludeth this,\nForbidding life to him on whom might crowd\nSuch irk and care; and granted 'tis to know:\nNothing for us there is to dread in death,\nNo wretchedness for him who is no more,\nThe same estate as if ne'er born before,\nWhen death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life.\nHence, where thou seest a man to grieve because\nWhen dead he rots with body laid away,\nOr perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,\nKnow well: he rings not true, and that beneath\nStill works an unseen sting upon his heart,\nHowever he deny that he believes.\nHis shall be aught of feeling after death.\nFor he, I fancy, grants not what he says,\nNor what that presupposes, and he fails\nTo pluck himself with all his roots from life\nAnd cast that self away, quite unawares\nFeigning that some remainder's left behind.\nFor when in life one pictures to oneself\nHis body dead by beasts and vultures torn,\nHe pities his state, dividing not himself\nTherefrom, removing not the self enough\nFrom the body flung away, imagining\nHimself that body, and projecting there\nHis own sense, as he stands beside it: hence\nHe grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks\nThat in true death there is no second self\nAlive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,\nOr stand lamenting that the self lies there\nMangled or burning. For if it an evil is\nDead to be jerked about by jaw and fang\nOf the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not\nBitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,\nOr suffocate in honey, and, reclined\nOn the smooth oblong of an icy slab,\nGrow stiff in cold, or sink with load of earth\nDown-crushing from above.\n\"Thee now no more\nThe joyful house and best of wives shall welcome,\nNor little sons run up to snatch their kisses\nAnd touch with silent happiness thy heart.\nThou shalt not speed in undertakings more,\nNor be the warder of thine own no more.\nPoor wretch,\" they say, \"one hostile hour hath ta'en\nWretchedly from thee all life's many guerdons,\"\nBut add not, \"yet no longer unto thee\nRemains a remnant of desire for them\"\nIf this they only well perceived with mind\nAnd followed up with maxims, they would free\nTheir state of man from anguish and from fear.\n\"O even as here thou art, aslumber in death,\nSo shalt thou slumber down the rest of time,\nReleased from every harrying pang. But we,\nWe have bewept thee with insatiate woe,\nStanding beside whilst on the awful pyre\nThou wert made ashes; and no day shall take\nFor us the eternal sorrow from the breast.\"\nBut ask the mourner what's the bitterness\nThat man should waste in an eternal grief,\nIf, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest?\nFor when the soul and frame together are sunk\nIn slumber, no one then demands his self\nOr being. Well, this sleep may be forever,\nWithout desire of any selfhood more,\nFor all it matters unto us asleep.\nYet not at all do those primordial germs\nRoam round our members, at that time, afar\nFrom their own motions that produce our senses-\nSince, when he's startled from his sleep, a man\nCollects his senses. Death is, then, to us\nMuch less- if there can be a less than that\nWhich is itself a nothing: for there comes\nHard upon death a scattering more great\nOf the throng of matter, and no man wakes up\nOn whom once falls the icy pause of life.\nThis too, O often from the soul men say,\nAlong their couches holding of the cups,\nWith faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry:\n\"Brief is this fruit of joy to paltry man,\nSoon, soon departed, and thereafter, no,\nIt may not be recalled.\"- As if, forsooth,\nIt were their prime of evils in great death\nTo parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought,\nOr chafe for any lack.\nOnce more, if Nature\nShould of a sudden send a voice abroad,\nAnd her own self inveigh against us so:\n\"Mortal, what hast thou of such grave concern\nThat thou indulgest in too sickly plaints?\nWhy this bemoaning and beweeping death?\nFor if thy life aforetime and behind\nTo thee was grateful, and not all thy good\nWas heaped as in sieve to flow away\nAnd perish unavailingly, why not,\nEven like a banqueter, depart the halls,\nLaden with life? why not with mind content\nTake now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest?\nBut if whatever thou enjoyed hath been\nLavished and lost, and life is now offence,\nWhy seekest more to add- which in its turn\nWill perish foully and fall out in vain?\nO why not rather make an end of life,\nOf labour? For all I may devise or find\nTo pleasure thee is nothing: all things are\nThe same forever. Though not yet thy body\nWrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts\nOutworn, still things abide the same, even if\nThou goest on to conquer all of time\nWith length of days, yea, if thou never diest\"-\nWhat were our answer, but that Nature here\nUrges just suit and in her words lays down\nTrue cause of action? Yet should one complain,\nRiper in years and elder, and lament,\nPoor devil, his death more sorely than is fit,\nThen would she not, with greater right, on him\nCry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill:\n\"Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon!\nThou wrinklest- after thou hast had the sum\nOf the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest ever\nWhat's not at hand, contemning present good,\nThat life has slipped away, unperfected\nAnd unavailing unto thee. And now,\nOr ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head\nStands- and before thou canst be going home\nSated and laden with the goodly feast.\nBut now yield all that's alien to thine age,-\nUp, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must.\"\nJustly, I fancy, would she reason thus,\nJustly inveigh and gird: since ever the old\nOutcrowded by the new gives way, and ever\nThe one thing from the others is repaired.\nNor no man is consigned to the abyss\nOf Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be,\nThat thus the after-generations grow,-\nThough these, their life completed, follow thee;\nAnd thus like thee are generations all-\nAlready fallen, or some time to fall.\nSo one thing from another rises ever;\nAnd in fee-simple life is given to none,\nBut unto all mere usufruct.\nLook back:\nNothing to us was all fore-passed eld\nOf time the eternal, ere we had a birth.\nAnd Nature holds this like a mirror up\nOf time-to-be when we are dead and gone.\nAnd what is there so horrible appears?\nNow what is there so sad about it all?\nIs't not serener far than any sleep?\nAnd, verily, those tortures said to be\nIn Acheron, the deep, they all are ours\nHere in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed\nWith baseless terror, as the fables tell,\nFears the huge boulder hanging in the air:\nBut, rather, in life an empty dread of gods\nUrges mortality, and each one fears\nSuch fall of fortune as may chance to him.\nNor eat the vultures into Tityus\nProstrate in Acheron, nor can they find,\nForsooth, throughout eternal ages, aught\nTo pry around for in that mighty breast.\nHowever hugely he extend his bulk-\nWho hath for outspread limbs not acres nine,\nBut the whole earth- he shall not able be\nTo bear eternal pain nor furnish food\nFrom his own frame forever. But for us\nA Tityus is he whom vultures rend\nProstrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats,\nWhom troubles of any unappeased desires\nAsunder rip. We have before our eyes\nHere in this life also a Sisyphus\nIn him who seeketh of the populace\nThe rods, the axes fell, and evermore\nRetires a beaten and a gloomy man.\nFor to seek after power- an empty name,\nNor given at all- and ever in the search\nTo endure a world of toil, O this it is\nTo shove with shoulder up the hill a stone\nWhich yet comes rolling back from off the top,\nAnd headlong makes for levels of the plain.\nThen to be always feeding an ingrate mind,\nFilling with good things, satisfying never-\nAs do the seasons of the year for us,\nWhen they return and bring their progenies\nAnd varied charms, and we are never filled\nWith the fruits of life- O this, I fancy, 'tis\nTo pour, like those young virgins in the tale,\nWaters into a sieve, unfilled forever.",

Don't hesitate to use items: Healing items such as potions and elixirs can save your life during tough battles. Use them wisely when needed, especially since you're playing solo.\n4. Keep track of your equipment: Upgrading your gear regularly helps improve your abilities against tougher foes. Visit the Smithy frequently to upgrade armor pieces and weapons.\n5. Communicate using emotes: Since voice chat isn't always possible while playing solo, utilize emotes to signal your team about what actions you plan to take next. This includes things like waving to indicate moving forward together or pointing at a monster for emphasis.\n6. Learn from failure: Death comes naturally in MH games, but don't let setbacks discourage you. Analyze why you died and adjust your strategy accordingly. Watch videos online for additional pointers on how to defeat specific monsters more effectively.\n7. Join forces with other players occasionally: While solo play can be rewarding, joining up with friends or strangers sometimes adds variety to the gameplay. Plus, working alongside others often leads to better strategies which could ultimately lead to success.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect! Stick with it, learn from your mistakes, and soon enough you'll be taking down monsters left and right. Good luck out there, hunter!",

        "human_text": "Piaf's tumultuous life receives a superb framework in this excellent biopic. I've read some criticism of Dahan's editing style which switches often to various parts of her all-too-brief life, but with a woman of such roiling emotions and dramatic upheavals, how could it not be so? The two things I found missing here were her WWII Resistance activities and her final marriage to a man twenty years her junior. But then again the film might have approached the three- hour mark and at nearly two and a half, you walk away feeling as though you witnessed a train wreck in slow-mo. Please do not let this prevent you from seeing an astonishingly fine recreation of a life that is so fully lived you cannot believe it. Piaf's magnificent, emotional singing is fully complemented by Cotillards balls to the wall performance. Heart and soul are in total sync here and Cotillard manages to age astonishingly well. This is a terrible tale of a child grotesquely abandoned emotionally by her parents. Piaf's will to live is inspiring even in the face of self-destruction that makes Judy Garland's own battles with alcohol and drugs seem minor in comparison. The parallels to both women are hard to ignore. The rest of the cast is first-rate, and the film beautifully evokes the eras covered in her life. Best of all there is the great Piaf recorded legacy which is well-handled here. There's no sense that Cotillard is not singing and that's a testament to the skill that suffuses this fine film. Excellent.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"I was completely captivated by this biopic about the legendary French singer Edith Piaf, portrayed with breathtaking authenticity by Marion Cotillard in her Oscar-winning performance. The film takes us on a heartbreaking journey through Piaf's life as she rises to fame and struggles against personal demons while remaining true to herself. With stunning cinematography that captures both the glamour and grit of Parisian nightlife during World War II, 'La Vie en Rose' is a must-see masterpiece.\"",

It formed in the southern Caribbean on October 9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October 16, corresponding to Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged the coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea. Due to its unusual loop, initial reports suggested it was two separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it was identified as a single storm. Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems that took similar paths.",
        "direct_prompt": "The 1910 Cuba hurricane was one of the deadliest hurricanes in Cuban history, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The storm formed over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 18th and moved northwestward towards Cuba. It hit Havana with full force on September 20th, producing sustained winds of up to 145 mph (233 km/h) and a storm surge that flooded much of the city.[1] \n\nAccording to historical records, the hurricane killed an estimated 2,000 people in Cuba,[2] making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in the country's history. Property damage was extensive, with many buildings destroyed or severely damaged. The port town of Regla, located west of Havana, suffered particularly heavy losses due to its low-lying location near the mouth of the harbor[3]. In addition to the human toll and property damages, crops were also heavily impacted by the storm; sugar cane fields were flattened throughout western Cuba[,4], leading to significant economic consequences for the island nation.\n\nDespite its devastating impact, the 1910 Cuba hurricane has been largely overlooked in historiography compared to other major storms such as the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane[] or more recent events like Hurricane Michelle []. However, its legacy can still be seen today through remnants of architecture from the era [], oral histories passed down among families who survived the disaster [6], and ongoing efforts to commemorate those lost during this tragic event 7].\n\nFootnotes: \n[1]: National Weather Service Office in Miami Florida https://www.weather.gov/mfl/history_of_hurricane_damage accessed October 2021\n[2]: Encyclopaedia Britannicahttps://www.britannica.com/event/Cuba-Havana-hurricane-of-1909-1911 accessed october2021\n[3]: University of Michigan Library http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cubanstudies/?rgn=main%7Ctitle=%22Regla,%201910.%E2%80%932011:%201023--0999---5----11-%28Periodico+Digital+-+Revista+digital.+Edici%C3%B3n+electr%C3%ADnica+.%--University+Of+Michigan++Library.--Ann+Arbor,+MI",

It is particularly bad news for BT, the UK's biggest internet supplier, with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.\nA third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro Magazine. \"We expect these figures to leap in 2005. Every month the prices drop, and more and more people are trying to switch,\" he said. The survey found that BT and Tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. Some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping.\nOther found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. Broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. \"We discovered a huge variety of problems, but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier,\" said Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro. \"This breaks the code of practice, but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or Ofcom can do to help,\" he said. There is a vast choice of internet service providers in the UK now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. With prices set to drop even further in coming months Mr Danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. \"If you just stick with your current connection then there's every chance you're being ripped off,\" he warned.",
        "direct_prompt": "LONDON - A recent survey has revealed that Britons are becoming increasingly frustrated with their internet services, citing slow speeds and unreliable connections as the main reasons for their dissatisfaction.\n\nThe study conducted by Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, found that almost half of all households in Britain have experienced problems with their broadband connection over the past year. Younger generations were particularly critical of the quality of service they received, with 60% of 18-24 year olds saying they had encountered issues.\n\nIn response to these concerns, Culture Secretary Karen Bradley has announced plans to launch an investigation into the state of digital infrastructure across the country. She acknowledged that improving connectivity was essential if Britain was to remain competitive on a global scale.\n\nHowever, some experts have criticised the government's approach to tackling the issue, arguing that more needs to be done to ensure everyone has access to fast and reliable broadband. They point out that many rural areas still lag behind when it comes to high speed internet, leaving residents at a disadvantage in terms of accessing vital services such as healthcare and education.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the latest initiative will prove successful in addressing the frustrations of British consumers, but one thing is clear: improved internet coverage must be a priority for policymakers if the nation is to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving digital age.",

Clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific, SOTD has it all. Of course, I didn't think I could go very far wrong with a film that George Romero himself said he enjoyed.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) isn't having a very good week. His co-workers have no respect for him, his uptight stepfather is on his back and his beloved girlfriend Liz has had enough of his laziness and inconsideration. Really, Shaun isn't such a bad guy, but he has no ambition and seems to prefer the company of his unemployed, flatulent, video-game obsessed slob of a flatmate Ed to anyone else. And as if this were not enough, the dead have risen and are walking the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon. Shaun doesn't notice this fact as quick as he should, but Shaun is somewhat of a zombie himself, lost in his own world and distracted by his own thoughts as he strolls right past the rotting cadavers that now fill the streets of Britain. Not even news flashes can get through to Shaun, as (in an incredibly hysterical scene) he channel surfs rapidly, every station finishing the sentence of the one before and giving everyone but the oblivious Shaun the grim news of what is happening in the world. When Shaun and Ed finally do realize what is happening, it quickly becomes a race against time: save Shaun's mum, rescue Liz and go to the pub where they can wait out the zombie infestation with a pint and a smoke. <br/><br/>Of course, not everything goes as smoothly as planned. There's undead flatmates to deal with, \"bitey\" zombies along the way, petty arguments between friends and Ed's cell phone going off at inopportune moments. But Shaun, armed with a cricket bat, is determined to save the woman he loves and nothing is going to get in his way!<br/><br/>This film should be seen side by side with Romero's \"Dawn of the Dead\" as both films cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombified society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead. There's not much gore here, but there is one very unexpected and Savini-worthy moment in \"Shaun\" when the zombies rip a living man to shreds, yanking out intestines and tearing off limbs. I really hadn't seen such a gory scene coming and was too stunned to look away. It's truly graphic and nauseating...and, though I usually hate gore, very well done. For a low budget film, the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in \"Shaun.\" There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry, I mean stepdad. Shaun himself is forced to grow up and take charge as the zombies close in around them. <br/><br/>I don't want to give away the incredible ending of \"Shaun\" except to say that the living dead are not immune from pop-culture commercialization, and though loved ones may die, video games are forever. <br/><br/>SEE THIS FILM!!! You do NOT have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate the sublime satire that is \"Shaun of the Dead.\" I haven't seen a movie this good for a very long time. 10 stars.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"If you're a fan of horror-comedy movies, then Shaun of the Dead is definitely worth checking out! The film combines hilarious witty dialogue with gory zombie action in a perfectly balanced way. It's clear that director Edgar Wright and actor Simon Pegg (who also co-wrote the script) had a blast making this movie, and their enthusiasm shines through in every scene. The supporting cast is equally fantastic, with cameos from famous British actors like Nick Frost and Dylan Moran adding even more charm to an already charming film.

        "human_text": "The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer.\nNo formal offer has been made yet, but Manchester United have confirmed they have received a \"detailed proposal\" from the US entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. Reports have put the offer at 300p per share, which would value Manchester United at about £800m ($1.5bn). The approach by the 76-year-old owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team is reportedly being led by his two sons, Avi and Joel. A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. However, the BBC has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.\nMr Glazer's previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed \"not... in the best interests of the company\" by Manchester United's board when they rejected his approach last year. However, Mr Glazer's latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m.\nWhile United's board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazer's latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.\nSupporters' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer's campaign - said it would fight any move. \"Manchester United are a debt-free company. We don't want to fall into debt and we don't need to fall into debt,\" Shareholders United's Sean Bones told the BBC. United's players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. \"A lot of people want the club's interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart,\" Rio Ferdinand told BBC Radio Five Live. \"No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.\"\nThe key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus. Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. Mr Glazer owns 28.1%. Joe McLean, a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was \"utterly crucial\". \"Mr Glazer's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. \"If that's the case, the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence, maybe 305. \"If that's the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead.\"\nIndeed it is. Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003. In February 2004 he said he was \"considering\" whether to bid for the club. No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a \"preliminary approach\", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. However, the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. At the club's annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. Legal adviser Maurice Watkins, commercial director Andy Anson and non-executive director Philip Yea were voted out, against the wishes of chief executive David Gill. But the move led to bankers JP Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick withdrawing from the Glazer bid team.",
        "direct_prompt": "Malcolm Glazer, the billionaire owner of Manchester United football club, has died at the age of 85. Mr Glazer bought the club in 2005 for £790m and oversaw significant changes during his ownership. Here are some key points about him and his time at Old Trafford.\n\nWho was Malcolm Glazer?\nMr Glazer was an American businessman who made his fortune through real estate and sports franchises. He owned the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and also had interests in other sporting organisations such as the NBA's Orlando Magic.\nWhy did he buy Manchester United?\nAt the time of the purchase, Sir Alex Ferguson was still manager and the team were one of the most successful in England and Europe. Mr Glazer saw the potential to increase revenue from commercial deals and expand the brand globally.\nWhat impact did he have on the club?\nUnder Mr Glazer's ownership, Manchester United became one of the richest clubs in the world with revenues soaring above £500million per year. However, there were criticisms that ticket prices rose too high for many fans while debt levels increased significantly. The team continued to be successful under Sir Alex but struggled after his retirement.\nWas he popular among supporters?\nThere were protests against Mr Glazer's ownership by fans due to concerns around ticketing policies and debts being piled onto the club. Some felt he put financial gain ahead of the team's success although others praised his investment in infrastructure like the training ground.\nDid he have any children involved in the club?\nYes, two of Mr Glazer's sons - Avram and Joel - took up roles within the organisation. Avram served as executive vice-chairman before resigning in 2014 amid controversy surrounding a failed takeover bid whereas Joel remained until 2017 when he stepped down following criticism regarding the handling of player transfers.\nIn summary, Malcolm Glazer was an influential figure in Manchester United's history whose tenure as owner saw both successes and controversies. His legacy will continue to be debated amongst fans and experts alike.",

Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",

        "human_text": "Sociocultural evolution, sociocultural evolutionism or cultural evolution are theories of sociobiology and cultural evolution that describe how societies and culture change over time. Whereas sociocultural development traces processes that tend to increase the complexity of a society or culture, sociocultural evolution also considers process that can lead to decreases in complexity (degeneration) or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity (cladogenesis). Sociocultural evolution is \"the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form\". Most of the 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches to socioculture aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a whole, arguing that different societies have reached different stages of social development. The most comprehensive attempt to develop a general theory of social evolution centering on the development of sociocultural systems, the work of Talcott Parsons (1902–1979), operated on a scale which included a theory of world history. Another attempt, on a less systematic scale, originated from the 1970s with the world-systems approach of Immanuel Wallerstein (1930-2019) and his followers.\n \nMore recent approaches focus on changes specific to individual societies and reject the idea that cultures differ primarily according to how far each one has moved along some presumed linear scale of social progress. Most modern archaeologists and cultural anthropologists work within the frameworks of neoevolutionism, sociobiology, and modernization theory.",
        "direct_prompt": "Sociocultural evolution refers to the process by which human societies and cultures change over time. This includes changes in social structures, beliefs, values, technologies, and other aspects of cultural life that are passed down from one generation to another. Sociocultural evolution is shaped by various factors such as environmental conditions, population growth, migration, and contact with other societies.\n\nOne key aspect of sociocultural evolution is the development of complex societies, characterized by division of labor, specialized roles, and hierarchical organization. The emergence of agriculture, around 10,000 years ago, marked a significant turning point in sociocultural evolution, leading to the rise of civilizations and states.[1] With increasing population density and specialization came the need for more efficient means of communication and coordination, giving rise to writing,[2] mathematics[3], and other forms of symbolic representation.\n\nAnother important factor in sociocultural evolution has been technological innovation, particularly in areas like transportation, communications, and energy production.[4] These innovations have enabled humans to access new resources, expand their territories, and create ever-more interconnected global networks.[5] Technological advancements have also had profound effects on society, including changing patterns of work,[6] leisure,[7] and interpersonal relationships.\"[8]\n\nIn recent decades, advances in information technology have accelerated the pace of sociocultural change, creating what some scholars refer to as a \"digital revolution.\" [9] The widespread adoption of smartphones[,10]social media platforms[/11][12], and other digital tools has transformed how people communicate,, collaborate,[13] and consumeinformation\"[14]. Digital technologies have also challenged traditional power dynamics within societies, enabling individuals and groups to organize and mobilize around shared interests or causes.,[15]\n\nDespite its many benefits, however, rapid sociocultural change can also lead to challenges and tensions. For example, it may exacerbate income inequality[[16]], erode traditional values and norms,[17] and contribute to feelings of disorientation and uncertainty among members of society.\",[18] Assuch, understanding the processes and drivers of sociocultural evolution remains an important area of study for anthropologists, historians, sociologists, and other researchers interested in understanding humanity's past and present.\",\n\nReferences:\n\n* Diamond, J.

        "human_text": "Microsoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its Xbox consoles due to safety concerns.\nThe company said the move was a \"preventative step\" after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. It affects Xboxes made before 23 October 2003 for all regions but mainland Europe - and consoles in that region made before 13 January 2004. Microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. The firm said fewer than one in 10,000 consoles had experienced component failures. The recall affects almost three quarters of all Xboxes sold around the world since its launch in 2001.\nIn a statement, it added: \"In almost all instances, any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console.\" But in seven cases, customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. In 23 cases, customers reported smoke damage, or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre. \"This is a preventative step we're choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents,\" said Robbie Bach, senior vice president, Microsoft home and entertainment division. \"We regret the inconvenience, but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do.\" Consumers can order a new cable from the Xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the UK. Microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. It advised users to turn off their Xboxes when not in use. A follow-up to Xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of 2006.",
        "direct_prompt": "Microsoft has announced that it is recalling some Xbox power cables after reports that they may pose a fire hazard. The company said in a statement that it had received a small number of complaints about the cords overheating and causing damage to property. Microsoft added that it was taking the issue seriously and was working to resolve the problem as soon as possible. It advised customers who own an affected cord to stop using it immediately and contact Microsoft for a replacement. The recall affects certain models of the Xbox One and Elite controllers, which use a two-pronged plug designed for use in North America. Microsoft did not specify how many units were affected by the recall but urged all customers with concerns to get in touch with its customer support team.",

In my humble opinion this film manages to be both Wes Anderson's funniest picture so far and his most melancholic. The utter uncompromising stylishness of his other work is also present here, perhaps even heightened, but in contrast to The Life Aquatic (and to a certain degree The Darjeeling Limited), the emphasis here is firmly on plot. The brave and often odd visuals never overwhelm the story and the audience never feels like they are not quite in on the joke, like in The Life Aquatic. The tone does tend to become a bit erratic, especially in the last third of the film when Anderson seems to want to pack so much into every frame that the film becomes a bit cartoonish at times (hence the not-perfect score from me). All in all, though, the plot is very balanced and the pacing is great. The two young leads are superb and the brave move by Anderson to place unknown actors front and centre pays off beautifully. The rest of the cast is on paper even more star-studded than The Royal Tenenbaums and yet Anderson never steers into unnecessary character development just to accommodate his stars. A touch here and a touch there are more than enough to paint a picture of a group of people who are eerily similar in their dissatisfaction with their lives and yet react quite differently to the two young lovers' dash (literally) for happiness. In conclusion, a must-see for Anderson fans and highly recommended for everyone else.",

Therefore, image segmentation methods for visualizing the\nextent of invasive and noninvasive components on pathology images could support\npathological examination. However, it is challenging for most of the recent\nsegmentation methods that rely on supervised learning to cope with unlabeled\npathology images. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to unsupervised\nrepresentation learning and clustering for pathology image segmentation. Our\nmethod consists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn feature\nrepresentations of training patches from a target image using the spherical\nk-means. The purpose of this phase is to obtain cluster centroids which could\nbe used as filters for feature extraction. In the second phase, we apply\nconventional k-means to the representations extracted by the centroids and then\nproject cluster labels to the target images. We evaluated our methods on\npathology images of lung cancer specimen. Our experiments showed that the\nproposed method outperforms traditional k-means segmentation and the\nmultithreshold Otsu method both quantitatively and qualitatively with an\nimproved normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 0.626 compared to 0.168\nand 0.167, respectively.

Trot and Cap'n Bill spend many of their days roaming the beaches near home, or rowing and sailing along the coast. One day, Trot wishes that she could see a mermaid; her wish is overheard, and granted the next day. The mermaids explain to Trot, and the distressed Cap'n Bill, that they are benevolent fairies; when they offer Trot a chance to pay a visit to their land in mermaid form, Trot is enthusiastic, and Bill is too loyal to let her go off without him. So begins their sojourn among the sea fairies. They see amazing sights in the land of Queen Aquarine and King Anko (including an octopus who is mortified to learn that he's the symbol of the Standard Oil Company). They also encounter a villain called Zog the Magician, a monstrous hybrid of man, animal, and fish. Zog and his sea devils capture them and hold them prisoner. The two protagonists discover that many sailors thought to have been drowned have actually been captured and enslaved by Zog.

Trot and Cap'n Bill are returned to human form, safe and dry after their undersea adventure.

Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.",
        "direct_prompt": "The Split-Caps investment scheme has agreed to pay £194 million in compensation to its victims, after it was found that the company had misled investors and engaged in fraudulent activities. The scheme, which promised high returns on investments, collapsed in 2018, leaving thousands of people with significant losses.\n\nThe settlement, which is one of the largest in UK financial history, will provide some relief to the victims of the scandal, many of whom are elderly or have been left financially devastated by their losses. It comes after a long campaign by regulators and advocacy groups to hold the company accountable for its actions.\n\nIn addition to the compensation payment, those affected by the scam will also be offered the opportunity to receive independent advice on how to recover any remaining funds they may be owed. The move follows similar settlements in other countries where Split-Caps operated, including Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe chairman of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Charles Randell, said: \"Today's agreement marks an important step towards providing much needed closure for those who lost money as a result of the Split-Caps fraud.\" He added that the FCA would continue to work to protect consumers from financial crime and ensure that those responsible are held to account.",

My only thing is, is when she gets mad at me for something, she goes straight to her guy best friend. We have talked about this guy several times. Sometimes she would text this guy more often than me. Yeah I was jealous maybe still am, but for example I was going to take her to an amusement park for her bday, I got called into work and could not go. I had no choice. But instead of maybe being a little bit understanding, she exploded saying I don't care about her or anything. Like all this stuff she does for me and I can't make a \"simple plan\" for her. So I found out recently she actually texted her guy best friend to go with her. He couldn't go so she begged him to hangout. Go to his baseball game or anything. This guy friend and her have had types of relations in the past if you know what I mean. But she says they just decided to be friends bc he wouldnt date her. I really feel like she does this all to plan to make me jealous for the \"trouble I caused\" and I used to be jealous but not anymore I'm kinda used to it so I don't care anymore.

        "human_text": "Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2, I love this movie to death. James Cameron's classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron (following Piranha Part Two, The Terminator). It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film, but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic. <br/><br/> Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor from the original \"Alien\", returns to Earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426 and this time it's war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, Mark Rolston , Ricco Ross, Colette Hiller, Daniel Kash ,Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.<br/><br/>I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley, Newt, Corporal Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven't mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don't like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love. <br/><br/> I know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. There's plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning, the creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the Girl/Fight the Aliens/and Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its' Ass...and, by the end, now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares (which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film).<br/><br/>This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.<br/><br/>10/10 I have the Blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it. I love this film to death it is my personal favorite sci-fi action film even Lance Henriksen from Hard Target and The Terminator is in here and he is the good guy.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"I've seen my fair share of sci-fi movies, but Aliens is one of the best in its genre. The action never stops and every scene keeps you on edge with tension. Sigourney Weaver's performance as Ripley is nothing short of incredible - she embodies strength and determination throughout the film. The special effects hold up even today, nearly 30 years later. If you're a fan of science fiction or just great films in general, do yourself a favor and watch Aliens.\"",

        "human_text": "The White Terror  was a period during the French Revolution in 1795 when a wave of violent attacks swept across much of France. The victims of this violence were people identified as being associated with the Reign of Terror – followers of Robespierre and Marat, and members of local Jacobin clubs. The violence was perpetrated primarily by those whose relatives or associates had been victims of the Great Terror, or whose lives and livelihoods had been threatened by the government and its supporters before the Thermidorean Reaction. Principally, these were, in Paris, the Muscadins, and in the countryside, monarchists, supporters of the Girondins, those who opposed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and those otherwise hostile to the Jacobin political agenda. The Great Terror had been largely an organised political programme, based on laws such as the Law of 22 Prairial, and enacted through official institutions such as the Revolutionary Tribunal, but the White Terror was essentially a series of uncoordinated attacks by local activists who shared common perspectives but no central organization. In particular locations, there were, however, more organized counter-revolutionary movements such as the Companions of Jehu in Lyon and the Companions of the Sun in Provence. The name 'White Terror' derives from the white cockades worn in the hats of royalists.",
        "direct_prompt": "The First White Terror was a period of political repression and violence that took place in Argentina between 1930 and 1932, during the presidency of General José Félix Uriburu. The name \"White Terror\" refers to the use of paramilitary groups, often dressed in white uniforms, to carry out violent attacks against perceived enemies of the government. These included trade unionists, politicians, journalists, and other individuals who were deemed to be subversive or anti-establishment.\n\nDuring this time, there were numerous instances of torture, kidnapping, assassination, and arbitrary arrest without warrant or trial. Many people disappeared without trace, their bodies never found. Some estimates suggest that as many as 10,000 people may have been killed during the First White Terror.\n\nOne of the most notorious incidents occurred in September 1931, when armed men attacked a meeting of labor leaders in the city of Campana, killing nine people and wounding several others. This became known as the \"Massacre of Campana\", and it served as a catalyst for widespread protests and strikes across the country.\n\nDespite international condemnation, including from neighboring countries such as Brazil and Chile, the Argentine government refused to take action against the perpetrators of the violence. Instead, they continued to rely on the paramilitaries to maintain control and suppress dissent.\n\nEventually, pressure from both domestic and international sources led to the fall of the Uriburu administration in 1932. However, the legacy of the First White Terror remained, setting a precedent for future military regimes in Argentina to employ similar tactics of terror and oppression.",

        "human_text": "After bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.\nThe US presidential election provided a showcase for many, aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. Experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. The first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the Iowa Game, commissioned by the Democrat hopeful Howard Dean. More than 20 followed suit, including Frontrunner, eLections, President Forever and The Political Machine, which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign, including having to cope with the media. Others helped raise the stakes during the Bush/Kerry contest by highlighting a candidate's virtues or his vices.\nThe phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games, a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.\n\"When I started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, I thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen,\" said Gonzalo Frasca, computer games specialist at the Information Technology University of Copenhagen. \"I must admit that I was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved,\" added the Uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns. Many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. The aim is to comment on international news events via games.\nThe ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way.\n\"Video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation,\" Mr Frasca told the BBC News website. This was the case with the one he created for a political party in Uruguay, Cambiemos, an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country's problems could be solved by working together. \"It's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games.\" Ultimately, Dr Frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes, fears and beliefs. \"Children learn a lot about the world through play. There is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up.\"\nBut experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns.\nThis is hardly surprising, compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. Only a few years ago, most politicians did not have a webpage, while now it is almost a must-have. Dr Frasca said: \"Political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. They represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them.\" \"It will not replace other forms of political propaganda, but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.\"",
        "direct_prompt": "In recent years, online gaming has become an increasingly popular platform for political engagement and activism. From virtual protests to in-game elections, players are using their avatars to make statements about real-world issues. This trend is being driven by several factors, including the growing influence of social media and the increasing accessibility of digital technology.\n\nOne example of this phenomenon can be seen in the game 'Second Life', where users can create their own characters and interact with others in a 3D world. In 2007, residents of the game created a replica of the Iraqi city of Ramadi and organized mock elections to simulate the country's parliamentary election. Similarly, the multiplayer game 'Eve Online' has been used as a platform for political debate, with players forming factions based on real-life ideologies such as libertarianism and socialism.\n\nThe use of video games for political purposes extends beyond just simulations and roleplaying games. Mobile apps like 'Pocket Constitution' allow gamers to learn about constitutional law while playing interactive quizzes. Additionally, some developers have incorporated current events into their gameplay mechanics, providing educational content through entertainment. For instance, '#Ferguson: A Digital Riot Game,' released in 2015, simulates the unrest that occurred following Michael Brown's death but encourages player agency towards peaceful protest rather than violence.\n\nWhile there may be concerns over the potential impact of these politically charged videogames on young minds or fears they could serve as propaganda tools, many experts argue that engaging people via entertaining mediums might encourage them to take more interest in civic affairs. As our society becomes evermore intertwined with technological advancements, it seems likely that we will continue to see innovative ways whereby individuals utilize electronic platforms both recreationally and socially conscious endeavors.",

        "human_text": "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"Tom Cruise gives another stellar performance in this romantic comedy-drama about a sports agent who has a moral epiphany and decides to start his own agency, taking with him only one client (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and a loyal assistant (Renée Zellweger). The film boasts great chemistry between its leads and a heartwarming story that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer all at once. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character provides some much-needed comedic relief while Renée Zellweger's role as the dedicated yet undervalued assistant adds depth to the narrative. Director Cameron Crowe expertly weaves together themes of love, loyalty, ambition, and personal growth into a cinematic masterpiece that still holds up today.\"",

It is an\nimportant problem in practice, for example, encountered in autonomous driving.\nIn order to gain robustness to such changes, long-term localization approaches\noften use segmantic segmentations as an invariant scene representation, as the\nsemantic meaning of each scene part should not be affected by seasonal and\nother changes. However, these representations are typically not very\ndiscriminative due to the limited number of available classes. In this paper,\nwe propose a new neural network, the Fine-Grained Segmentation Network (FGSN),\nthat can be used to provide image segmentations with a larger number of labels\nand can be trained in a self-supervised fashion. In addition, we show how FGSNs\ncan be trained to output consistent labels across seasonal changes. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments that integrating the fine-grained\nsegmentations produced by our FGSNs into existing localization algorithms leads\nto substantial improvements in localization performance.",

        "human_text": "The 'bad behaviour' of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found.\nAccording to a survey conducted by security firm Mirapoint and market research company the Radicati Group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. One in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. Clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts.\nThe fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. \"This preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us,\" said Marcel Nienhuis, market analyst at the Radicati Group. \"It explains why e-mail security threats including spam, viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate,\" he said, accusing users of \"bad e-mail behaviour\". Spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month, according to security firm Clearswift. It has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney Sony PSP giveaways. And, in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the American drama series Desperate Housewives, it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. But rather than finding a companion, users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites, where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their PC. Clearswift has seen a 180% rise in sex-related spam over the course of the last month. \"Without casting aspersions, those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that 'one thing leads to another' but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus, clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems,\" said Alyn Hockey, Clearswift's director of research.\nSexually explicit terms make up 14% of security firm Sophos' top 50 word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. Spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for security firm Sophos. \"The list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites: money, drugs and sex,\" said Mr Cluley. But anti-spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail. \"People must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. Spammers are criminals, plain and simple. If no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn't buy products sold in this way, then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs,\" he said.",
        "direct_prompt": "In today's digital age, email has become an essential tool for communication in both personal and professional settings. However, despite its widespread use, many people still engage in bad email habits that contribute to the ongoing problem of spam. Spam is unsolicited or unwanted emails sent en masse to multiple recipients, often with malicious intent such as phishing scams or spreading malware.\n\nOne common bad email habit is failing to check the recipient list before sending an email. This can result in unintended recipients receiving sensitive information or spammy content. Another issue is using generic subject lines or none at all, which makes it difficult for recipients to identify important messages amidst their inbox clutter. Sending attachments without compressing them also contributes to increased email size and potential delays in delivery.\n\nMoreover, clicking on suspicious links or opening unknown attachments from unverified sources increases the risk of downloading malware onto your device or falling victim to cybercrime. Responding to spam by replying or forwarding it only serves to validate the sender's email address, leading to more spam being sent to your inbox.\n\nWhile there are various filters and anti-spam tools available to combat this issue, individuals must take responsibility for their own email etiquette to reduce the prevalence of spam. By adopting good email practices such as double-checking recipient lists, crafting specific subject lines, avoiding unnecessary attachments, and exercising caution when interacting with unfamiliar emails, we can help mitigate the impact of spam on our inboxes and online security.",

        "human_text": "When young Dewey Cox accidentally cuts his brother in half with a machete, it sets him on a long, hard, and winding road that traverses the most profoundly important moments in modern music history spanning the 1950's to today. \"Walk Hard\" was erroneously advertised as yet another comedic romp from Judd Apatow. While as the co-screenwriter here many of Apatow's trademarks can be found including the usual sophomoric sexual humor and ironic pop-culture references, \"The Dewey Cox Story\" is actually closer in spirit to the mocumentaries of Christopher Guest (\"This is Spinal Tap!\" and \"Best in Show\") as channeled through the spastic colon of the \"Naked Gun\" films.<br/><br/>This is a parody played hilariously straight. The target of its mockery is so succinct and sharply pointed--the recent Oscar-winning musical biopics \"Ray\" and \"Walk the Line\"--that the film's true comedic genius may be lost on people who didn't really pay attention to those films or thought this would just be another \"Superbad.\" The film's mimesis of its source materials is so spot-on, that it even follows their same cadence and nearly falls apart midway as it glosses over many points in history and aspects of the musician's life while covering every cliché possible from the temptations of life on the road with drugs and groupies to bouts in rehab and bitter divorces to long dry periods that suddenly make way for life-altering inspiration.<br/><br/>At the center of \"Walk Hard\" is John C. Reilly who sings and acts his heart out to hilarious effect. A former Oscar nominee for \"Chicago\", Reilly has since cut a niche for himself as the second banana to bigger comedy stars like Will Ferrell in \"Talladega Nights\" and for the first time gets a film to call his own. Tim Meadows is shockingly funny as the friend who ushers in Cox's decent into drug use (his overly accentuated but still deadpan line deliveries are priceless), while Jenna Fishcher is sprite and lovely as the June Carter cutie to Cox's Johnny Cash wannabee. Other SNL players including Kristin Wiig and Chris Parnell and Apatow alumni like Paul Rudd (as John Lennon!) and Jonah Hill pop in and out of the film amidst an onslaught of funny sight-gags and one-liners. Also in on the fun is a cavalcade of current music stars including the lead singer of the White Stipes as Elvis and Eddie Vedder as himself doing a nonsensical quasi-spiritual riff on Cox's legacy while presenting a Lifetime Achievement Award.<br/><br/>The heart of \"Walk Hard\" is in the music. If you were to not listen so closely, you might be fooled into thinking these were actual hit songs from their respective time periods. Of course, listening to the lyrics is part of the fun. The ridiculously silly double-entendres in Cox's duet with his honey-to-be Darlene are especially funny, while I personally found their spoof of a Bob Dylan song to be downright brilliant. Since the writers took the time to be so verbose and intricate with their nonsensical free-form versing, they allowed the bit to work on multiple levels as both an homage and a biting jab at Dylan's alleged lyrical genius.<br/><br/>Utimately \"Walk Hard\", in ways both monumentally stupid and unfathomably smart, proves to be almost too clever for its own good. It may have bombed in it's first-run at the box office, but I would imagine it will eventually find its audience. In one pivotal early scene Cox begs his wife to believe in him and his dreams of becoming a successful singer. She replies something to the effect of, \"Oh, baby, I do. I just believe you're gonna fail.\" I couldn't have said it better myself, and it still has me laughing.",

Once leader of the liberal Democratic Union, he joined the SPD in 1912. He defected to the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) in 1917 due to his opposition to the First World War, and rejoined the SPD in 1922. He served as a senior member of and foreign policy spokesman for the SPD Reichstag group during the Weimar Republic, and was a member of the German delegation to the League of Nations. After the Nazi rise to power, he was among the members of the Reichstag who voted against the Enabling Act of 1933, and soon after fled to France to avoid persecution. He was arrested and handed to the Gestapo in 1941, and died in Buchenwald concentration camp in 1944. Early life\nBreitscheid was born on 2 November 1874 in Cologne to working-class Protestant parents. His father Wilhelm worked in a bookshop, and died when Rudolf was nine years old. His mother Wilhelmine was the daughter of a tailor. He began studying law at Cologne's Friedrich-Wilhelm Gymnasium in 1894, but moved within the year to Marburg to study politics.

The $499 Macintosh, sold for £339 in the UK, was described by Jobs as the \"most important Mac\" made by Apple. Mr Jobs also unveiled the iPod shuffle, a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives, which are used in more expensive iPods.\nThe new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally, the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. The Mac mini comes without a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $599.\nThe machine - which will be available from 22 January - was described by Jobs as \"BYODKM... bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse\". In an attempt to win over Windows PC customers, Mr Jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. \"People who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses,\" he said. \"It's the newest and most affordable Mac ever.\" The new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. In January, Apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. Ian Harris, deputy editor of UK magazine Mac Format, said the machine would appeal to PC-owning consumers who had purchased an iPod.\n\"They want a further taste of Mac because they like what they have seen with iPod.\" Harris added: \"Everybody thought that Apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers, and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like Dell is a bold move. \"But it shows that Apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it's had with the iPod. The Mac mini will appeal to PC users looking for an attractive, 'no fuss' computer.\" The new iPod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering 512mb of storage for $99 (£69 in the Uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $149 (£99) - and went on sale Tuesday. The music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. The smaller iPod will hold about 120 songs, said Mr Jobs. Mr Jobs told the delegates at MacWorld that iPod already had a 65% market share of all digital music players.",
        "direct_prompt": "In an effort to expand its customer base and tap into new markets, Apple has announced the launch of a lower-priced Mac Mini computer. The new device is aimed at consumers who are looking for an affordable entry point into the world of macOS but may have been put off by the higher price tag of previous models.\n\nThe new Mac Mini comes with updated internals including an 8th generation Intel processor and support for up to 64GB of RAM. It also features four Thunderbolt 3 ports, allowing users to connect multiple displays or high-speed peripherals. Despite the reduced price, the device still boasts many of the same features as its more expensive counterparts such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nPriced at just $799, the new Mac Mini represents a significant reduction in cost compared to other Mac devices on offer. This move from Apple signals a shift towards making their products more accessible to a wider range of customers, particularly those who might be hesitant to make the leap into the Mac ecosystem due to the traditionally high prices associated with the brand.\n\nDespite concerns around declining sales in recent years, Apple remains committed to its desktop offerings and sees this latest release as a way to bolster its position in the market while attracting newcomers to the platform. With rumors swirling about potential updates to the iMac line later this year, it seems that Apple is determined to keep its hold on the desktop space despite increasing competition from rival companies like Microsoft and Dell.",

This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.<br/><br/>This movie is about an aging lord, head of the Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro, the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.<br/><br/>Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is, with astonishing story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.<br/><br/>10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius",
        "direct_prompt": "\"I have seen 'Ran' multiple times and each viewing only reinforces my belief that this is one of the greatest films ever made. Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear is nothing short of breathtaking, with stunning visuals, powerful performances, and an emotional depth that stays with you long after the credits roll. The battle scenes are intense and visceral, while the character arcs are nuanced and relatable. This film truly has it all – drama, action, tragedy, comedy, and even a touch of horror. If you haven't experienced 'Ran', do yourself a favor and watch it immediately.\"",

Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.",
        "direct_prompt": "LONDON - A new report has warned that millions of workers in the global textile industry could lose their jobs as automation and artificial intelligence continue to advance, leading to significant changes in the sector.\n\nThe study by consulting firm McKinsey & Company found that up to 30% of tasks currently performed by human employees across various stages of clothing production may be automated within a decade. This includes cutting fabric, sewing garments, and packing orders for delivery.\n\nWhile these technological advances are expected to increase efficiency and reduce costs, they will also lead to job losses on a large scale, particularly in developing countries where the garment manufacturing industry is a major employer. The impact would likely affect both skilled and unskilled labor alike.\n\nAccording to experts, this shift towards greater automation comes at a time when many low-cost producing nations have already seen wages rise significantly, making it harder for them to compete with other countries offering cheaper labor. As such, those most affected by job cuts might struggle to find alternative employment opportunities in sectors less impacted by technology.\n\nHowever, some analysts believe there may still be room for optimism if governments work together with industries to invest in education and training programs aimed at equipping people with skills needed for emerging roles related to advanced technologies like data analysis or software development. Such efforts can help mitigate potential social unrest while ensuring continued growth within the evolving textiles landscape.",

This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. <br/><br/>The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. <br/><br/>The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. <br/><br/>After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail – although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then – and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). <br/><br/>We are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here – the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. <br/><br/>The casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame – only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt – Lord Hesketh, \"Bubbles\" Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. <br/><br/>The love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame – as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. <br/><br/>The attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film \"feels\" like it's happening in the 70's. <br/><br/>For anyone interested in great personal stories, F1, the 70's, cars or just like to see a great film, then Rush is for you.",

        "human_text": " Kolbert visits Shishmaref and Fairbanks, Alaska, to speak with both the townspeople and scientists about the effect global warming is having in Alaska. In Shishmaref, towns are being forced off of the coastal regions because ice that had once protected these towns from storms and large waves, have melted. In Fairbanks Kolbert met with scientist Vladimir Romanovsky to study how global warming is affecting the permafrost levels in Alaska. Romanovsky’s research shows that as permafrost melts it releases carbon dioxide, which has been trapped in the permafrost for thousands of years and is harmful to the environment. Kolbert also discusses the spectrometer used by Donald Perovich on the expedition, Des Groseilliers. The spectrometer was used to measure the light reflected off of the ice and snow. The discovery that the snow reflected more than the ocean is important because the ocean is being heated by global warming and melting the ice which is making the water levels rise. This section explains the history of researchers exploring human influence on climate change. At the beginning, it states that global warming is not a fad because it has been researched since the mid-19th century. John Tyndall was the first to research global warming; he did this by creating the first Spectrophotometer. This is an instrument used to measure the absorptive properties of gases. Through his research of gases, he discovered what is today called “The Greenhouse Effect.” The Greenhouse effect is the absorption and retention of heat from radiation. After the death of John Tyndall, Svante Arrhenius took over his position as the main researcher of global warming. He was the first to connect industrialization to climate change and even today NASA scientists credit him with insightful predictions: “His understanding of the role of carbon dioxide in heating Earth, even at that early date, led him to predict that if atmospheric carbon dioxide doubled, Earth would become several degrees warmer.” After the death of Arrhenius, most scientists believed that if levels were rising at all, they were rising very slowly. In the mid-1950s, Charles David Keeling found a more precise way to record levels and began recording the data. He brought us the Keeling Curve which shows the steady rise of levels since 1958. Kolbert travels to a research station in Greenland called Swiss Camp that was set up in 1990 and built into the ice floes. Kolbert meets Konrad Steffan, the director of Swiss Camp, who studies the meteorological conditions on the ice sheets at the equilibrium line (the point at which winter snow and summer snow melt are supposed to be exactly in balance). Steffan’s research shows that the glaciers have been melting faster (at a rate of 12 cubic miles per year), creating much more flooding in the area during the warmer months. These glaciers contain vast amounts of fresh water, which, when melted into the salt water of the oceans, begins to change ocean current patterns, thus resulting in some places around the world becoming colder and some becoming warmer. From obtaining ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet, it has been found that the average temperatures have risen twenty degrees within the past ten years thus resulting in the beginning of the disintegration of the entire Greenland ice sheet, which will be impossible to stop. It has also been found that rapid warming has occurred in the past, which then proceeded to fall into ice age conditions. In November 2004, there was a study presented in Reykjavik, Iceland, that explained how the Arctic climate is warming and the U.S. responded by stating they would effectively take action to combat the problem but would not make it an obligation. The scientists studying the situation have seen how humans have become the dominating factor in influencing climate change; in the professional world, global warming is not necessarily thought to be a natural process. This chapter describes Kolbert's interviews with scientists from around the world who have conducted experiments to prove that climate change inevitably affects many organisms' genetic structures and habitats. Kolbert attempts to reveal that global warming is the cause for these events. She interviews three biologists, Chris Thomas, William Bradshaw and Christina Holzapfel, and one paleoecologist, Thomas Web III. Kolbert follows scientific observations based upon the studies of the Comma Butterfly, the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii, the Golden Toad and pollen grains, among many other studies. Kolbert is concerned with the frightening reality that if species are being genetically changed and on the verge of extinction that the availability of our natural resources for future will be in jeopardy. Kolbert visits GISS, a former branch of NASA, which analyzes and produces various geographic models to demonstrate the behavior of the atmosphere, land surfaces, and ice sheets. According to GISS, more and more droughts are being triggered, which we aren’t able to adapt to with our way of living. This problem also arose in ancient civilizations, such as with the Mayans and in the city of Shekhna, when they reached their technological peak. The ancient city of Shekhna in present-day Syria has shown evidence that the culture died from drought. Kolbert cites scientific evidence based on geological models that chart the geographic downfall of other ancient civilizations that have experienced climate change. During ancient times, however, the technology had yet to be developed and they did not have the proper scientific abilities to adapt to extreme changes like massive drought. Kolbert argues that we may be technologically advanced, but as we continue to progress, we are becoming more and more destructive to the environment as well. In chapter six, Kolbert visits the Netherlands where the Dutch have made many provisions to prevent the increasing problem of widespread flooding. Water-ministry official Eelke Turkstra predicts that the Nieuwe Merwede canal will rise several feet above the local dikes around 2100 due to the flooding. The two main problems are caused by warming water that leads to expansion and raises the sea level, another is due to precipitation changes produced by a warming Earth. Turkstra believes that instead of building more dikes, the existing dikes should be dismantled to make room for the rising water. He wants to buy polders (land that has been laboriously reclaimed from the water) from farmers and lower surrounding dikes around them to create more area for the rising water. Then, Kolbert talks to Dura Vermeer who creates amphibious homes which will float on the water if a flood were to occur. Kolbert interviews Robert Socolow, the co-director for the Carbon Mitigation Initiative, about BAU or “business as usual”, which is a future in which current emissions trends continue without being checked. Socolow came up with a plan to help keep carbon emissions down but in order for his plans to work they must start taking effect as soon as possible. Socolow’s plan consisted of a fifteen point system where each point, known as a “stabilization wedge”, would reduce carbon emission by one billion metric tons a year. The wedges consisted of finding alternative fuel sources such as wind, solar and nuclear power, along with developing new technology and upgrading current technology to reduce carbon emission. Socolow argues that the government needs to get involved in order help motivate people to lower carbon emissions. Kolbert also interviews Marty Hoffert, Professor of physics at New York University. Hoffert believes that in order to fight global warming, people have to come up with new ways to generate power without producing carbon. This can be achieved, as he proposes, through satellite solar power (SSP). SSP means collecting solar energy using orbiting satellites which beam the power to ground using microwaves for collection by a rectenna. Energy can be transferred to Earth 24 hours a day without interference from clouds or nightfall. Hoffert also argues that we must change our view on global warming and divert from the BAU or else our civilization will not last. The Kyoto Protocol, active as of February 16, 2005, is a worldwide effort between nations to control greenhouse gas emissions. It began in 1992 and was supported by the U.S. president George H.W. Bush, who attended the U.N. Framework Convention where the U.S. agreed, along with other Annex 1 countries (China, Canada, Japan and nations of Europe included), to “return their emissions to 1990 levels,” or below. Clinton, succeeding president to Bush, also supported the protocol, but emission levels kept rising and not much was accomplished during his term. The Bush administration pulled the U.S. out of Kyoto in 2001 (it was one of only two nations to do so), where George W. Bush, who once promised solutions for controlling CO2 emissions during his campaign, now took a different stand that no longer supported Kyoto because, as he said to the public, the “state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to, global climate change”, are “incomplete”. Greenhouse gases are increasing rapidly (20% since 1990) and the US accounts for 34% of Annex 1 emissions. Since 2000, the Bush administration began using a “greenhouse gas intensity system”, which measures the ratio of emissions to economic output as a way of measuring emissions as a whole. Kolbert argues that the system is misleading and favors industrial development because while greenhouse gas levels are actually rising, according to this system they are supposedly falling. According to Kolbert, the improper feed of information to the public is also supplement by books and web groups funded by huge corporations such as Exxon Mobil and General Motors, who are giving out information contradicting proven and alarming scientific evidence about global warming. Articles produced are falsely stating, among many things, that weather can’t be predicted ahead of time, global warming isn’t real and hasn’t been proven, or that a warming climate is something to celebrate. Kolbert writes about Burlington, Vermont’s largest city. Years ago, the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. This helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. Burlington’s electric department (BED) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. The BED also leases compact fluorescent light bulbs for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. The city of Burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. Burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process a “closed loop”. Clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across America beginning with Greg Nickles, the mayor of Seattle, who created a set of principles called the “US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement”. This agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people. This agreement is trying to prove how much can be done at the local level and Clavelle hopes that more cities will adopt this plan. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California later issued an executive order to drastically reduce California's greenhouse gas emissions. Kolbert wraps up the book's main ideas by introducing a few new ideas and themes about climate change that had not been previously mentioned. The chapter starts out saying that modern humans are one of the primary influences on our environment and that we are entering an era aptly named the “Anthropocene” — the age of Homo sapiens. Kolbert also discusses the impacts and discovery of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. Most of what she discusses about CFCs in this chapter is based around the discovery of their negative impact on our ozone layer and the fact that this discovery only came about by accident. Kolbert also writes that we as a species can either come together to survive, or protect our self-interests as Earth’s climate continues to spiral out of our control. As Kolbert points out at the end of the chapter, if nothing changes in the way society looks at climate change, the world will tear itself apart. There is proof of this today, as entire countries evacuate due to severe weather changes, or others fight to control major resources such as food, water, and shelter. As people living in developed countries, we often take these basic needs for granted and do not realize how precious they really are.",

        "human_text": "Three years after a gruelling economic crisis, Turkey has dressed its economy to impress.\nAs part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 December, when the European Union will decide whether to start entry talks - Turkey's economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. The economy is growing fast, they insist. Education levels among its young and large population are rising. Unemployment levels, in percentage terms, are heading fast towards single digits. Inflation is under control. A new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (£10.8bn) in three years.\nMoreover, government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. Income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. A loan restructuring deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pretty much in the can. And following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts, its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent.\nThe point of all this has been to convince Europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU, allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.\n\"The cake will be bigger for everybody,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener earlier this month. \"Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget.\" If admitted into the EU, Turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; £6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country's State Planning Organisation. As Turkey's gross domestic output (GDP) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. Turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in \"Old Europe\" once its population comes of age. By 2014, one in four Turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less. \"A literate and qualified Turkish population,\" insisted Mr Sener, \"will make a positive impact on the EU.\"\nThis runs contrary to the popular view that Turkey is getting ready to dig deep into EU taxpayers' wallets. However, Turkey's assertions are confirmed by Brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy. But only over time. Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros. This would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid, though such payments should decline as the country's farm sector, which currently employs one in three Turks, would employ just one in five by 2020.\nSuch high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunned.\nSome fear that rather than providing an educated, sophisticated labour force for Europe at large, the people who will leave Turkey to seek work abroad will be poor, uneducated - and plentiful. More recently, less palatable concerns - at least in liberal European circles - have been voiced, with senior EU or member state officials talking darkly of a \"river of Islam\", an \"oriental\" culture and a threat to Europe's \"cultural richness\". Of course, many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country's Muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government's human rights record. Yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.\nCritics insist that much of the optimism about Turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country's current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.\nThe country's massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU. \"In the new member states of the European Union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product,\" says Reza Moghadam, assistant director of the IMF's European Department. \"At about 80% of GDP, Turkey's gross debt is double that figure.\" Turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession. \"There is no question that although Turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable,\" says Michael Deppler, director of the IMF's European Department. \"Its debt is far too high for an emerging economy.\" A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria. But economics is not a science. And although the state of Turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 December will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.",

The government is also considering reducing corporate tax rates and simplifying regulations for businesses. Despite concerns over human rights violations and press freedom, many investors are still drawn to Turkey's large consumer market and strategic location between Europe and Asia. However, some analysts warn that these measures may not be enough to reverse Turkey's economic decline, and that deeper structural reforms are needed to restore investor confidence.",

        "direct_prompt": "Henry O'Hara was an American poet, editor and critic who made significant contributions to modernist poetry in the early 20th century. Born on August 8, 1906, in Baltimore, Maryland, O'Hara grew up in New York City where he attended Columbia University.[1] He began his career as a journalist before turning to writing and publishing poetry. \n\nO'Hara's first book of poems, \"Apparitions,\" was published in 1930 when he was just 24 years old. The collection received critical acclaim for its innovative use of language and form, which marked him as one of the leading figures of the emerging modernist movement[2]. Throughout his career, O'Hara continued to experiment with poetic forms and styles, pushing the boundaries of traditional verse. His work often incorporated elements of jazz music,[3] stream-of-consciousness narration[,4], and non-traditional punctuation [5].[6][7]  In addition to his own writing, O'Hara also played a key role in promoting the work of other young poets through his editorship of several literary magazines including 'Broom', 'Trend','and 'Poetry'.[8]\n \nThroughout his life, Henry Ohara remained committed to advancing the art of Poetry.He taught at various universities such as Sarah Lawrence College,Columbia university among others.. In 1950s ohara moved back to Europe after spending some time teaching college students about creative Writing.,where lived until 1960s then returned again to United States settling down permanently in San Francisco California were died aged 68 due to heart failure caused by complications from diabetes that had plagued him throughout much of his adult life.\n     \nHis legacy continues to influence contemporary poets today, particularly those interested in exploring new ways of expressing emotion and experience through language.(9) Some scholars consider oharas works are still not well known enough compared to many contemporaries but they remain important touchstone texts within Modernism studies(10). Despite this relative obscurity, however, there is no denying that henry OHARA remains one of most influential voices in american literature history (11).",

The people who are in on the joke are people who, like myself, have an oversized love and knowledge of the city of Los Angeles and it's history. I think that in the vast, world-wide movie-going public, this group probably comprises 1%. For that group, \"1941\" has a wonderful nostalgia value. And for the people in that 1% that have a twisted sense of humor and enjoy seeing nostalgic L.A. blown to bits, this movie really delivers. By the way, the folks with that twisted sense of humor probably account for about 1% of the original 1%.<br/><br/>I don't know why, but having grown up in L.A. and being an aficionado of it's history, I find it funny to see planes in a dogfight over Hollywood Blvd, the ferris wheel rolling off the end of Santa Monica Pier, and aircraft crashing into the La Brea Tarpits. But for non-locals and people unfamiliar with the paranoia that gripped Southern California in the wake of Pearl Harbor, this movie will likely seem confusing and silly. To the history buff with a twisted sense of humor (like me, proud member of the 1% of the 1%), the movie is not only amusing, but sometimes surprisingly accurate, historically. Robert Stack plays General Joseph Stillwell - a very real historical figure in L.A. history. Stack even bears a striking resemblance to the real General Stillwell. The whole movie is based upon a few real-life incidents of panicky anti-aircraft fire that occurred over L.A. in 1941/1942, as well as a Japanese sub that actually shelled an oil refinery near Santa Barbara. Like \"Chinatown\" (a film mistakenly thought to be an accurate account of L.A. water politics in the 1930s), \"1941\" borrows from real-life history and distorts it into pure fabrication. The difference is that while \"Chinatown\" is a noir drama,  \"1941\" is an over-the-top comedy. Both films appeal to the historian, but as it is often said, comedy is much harder to pull off than drama. You either love \"1941\", or sit though it, saying, \"huh?\".",

The film masterfully captures the fear, tension and uncertainty felt by Americans during this time period while also highlighting the bravery and resilience of those who stood up against injustice. The special effects are top-notch and transport viewers back in time, making them feel as though they're living through these historic moments themselves. Overall, \"1941\" is a must-watch for anyone interested in World War II history or looking for an adrenaline rush from start to finish. 10/10 would recommend!",

Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games. But he believes the European Indoors in Madrid represent a chance for the 26-year-old to prove his credentials as Britain's top triple jumper. \"He has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning,\" said Edwards. \"Phillips still needs to be much more consistent. I'm sure a victory in Madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world.\" The qualifying round of the men's triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday. Olympic champion Christian Olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury.",
        "direct_prompt": "Laura Edwards, Great Britain's most successful female artistic gymnast, has tipped Ellie Downie to win gold at this year's European Championships in Glasgow. The 21-year-old from Hartlepool won silver on the uneven bars and bronze on the balance beam at last year's World Championships in Doha, Qatar, and is hoping to build on that success when she competes at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre next month. Downie, who trains with Edwards' coach Adrian Guerra at his gym in Madrid, Spain, will be competing in her first senior Europeans after making her international debut earlier this year. Speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, Edwards said: \"Ellie has got such potential - she can do everything so well. She just needs to believe in herself and go out there and perform.\" Edwards, who retired from competition in 2017 but remains involved in the sport as a coach and commentator, added: \"She's been working really hard over the past few months and I think it'll pay off at these championships. I'm confident she'll do very well indeed.\"",

When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, \"Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie\". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and,yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan'.",

Director Craig Brewer creates a gritty and visceral world that feels both familiar and fresh, drawing you into the sweaty depths of its characters' desires and demons.

        "human_text": "100th Window is the fourth studio album by English electronic music group Massive Attack, released on 10 February 2003 by Virgin Records. Of the group's original core line-up, the album only features Robert Del Naja; Andrew Vowles departed shortly after the release of the group's previous album Mezzanine (1998), and Grant Marshall refused to participate in the making of the record. 100th Window was written and produced by Del Naja and Neil Davidge, and features vocals from Horace Andy, Sinéad O'Connor, and Damon Albarn (performing as 2D from Gorillaz). It is also the first album by the group that makes no use of samples, and contains none of the jazz or jazz fusion stylings of the group's first two albums Blue Lines (1991) or Protection (1994). Background\nWork on the album started in early 2000 at the Christchurch Studios in Clifton, Bristol. Massive Attack recruited Lupine Howl (a band made up of ex-members of Spiritualized) for the new album. In a November 2001 interview, Lupine Howl's lead singer Sean Cook described the sessions as \"very experimental ... that essentially consisted of kinda minimal loops and noises that were fed to our headphones from the computer up in the control room. Then we would have this sort of extended jam session playing along to them and they would do various things to do the loops. Sometimes they would drop out the loop, sometimes they would start processing it with effects and delays and stuff like that, to try and make it change in various ways and see what that would do in terms of our playing. They also had a strobe light in the live room, which they controlled from the control room. They would kind of put that on and speed it up to dictate the intensity and try to affect the way we played with the lighting. It was a really good laugh; we got some good stuff. I mean, hours and hours of stuff, which they have taken back and cut up and arranged and done their things to.\"",

Motivated by these\nobservations, in this paper we explore simple yet effective strategies to model\nlong-term temporal dependencies. Inspired by the non-local operators of [70],\nwe introduce a technique to establish dense correspondences between pixel\nembeddings of a reference \"anchor\" frame and the current one. This allows the\nlearning of pairwise dependencies at arbitrarily long distances without\nconditioning on intermediate frames. Without online supervision, our approach\ncan suppress the background and precisely segment the foreground object even in\nchallenging scenarios, while maintaining consistent performance over time. With\na mean IoU of $81.7\\%$, our method ranks first on the DAVIS-2016 leaderboard of\nunsupervised methods, while still being competitive against state-of-the-art\nonline semi-supervised approaches.

        "human_text": " In an alternate world, where the existence of God has been scientifically proven and magic has been harnessed for the practical needs of the adept by the degaussing of cold iron, the United States is part of an alternative Second World War in which the enemy is not Germany but a resurgent Islamic Caliphate, which has invaded the United States. Werewolf Steven Matuchek and witch Virginia meet on a military mission to stop the invading Islamic army from unleashing a secret superweapon, a genie released from a bottle in which it had been sealed by King Solomon. Together, they fight against the demon and incidentally fall in love with each other. After the end of the war (an Allied victory as in our World War II, but U. S. forces remain in occupation of former enemy lands for much longer) the two of them continue and deepen their liaison and have various additional adventures (which were originally published as a series of independent stories). Among other things they stop an elemental summoned as a college prank which had gone amok, confront a succubus/incubus on their honeymoon, and enter the Hell dimension to save their daughter (who has been kidnapped and taken there, with a changeling left in her crib in her place). Some parts of the book can be seen as a kind of social satire. For example, the widespread use of flying brooms and carpets (actually, both have cabins mounted on top of the basic flying instrument) provides in this world a non-polluting flying substitute for cars, which encounters no traffic jams as it can use the whole of the sky. Later, in Hell the protagonists encounter an especially nasty form of torture reserved for heavy sinners: to be enclosed in horrible, clumsy ground vehicles which emit noxious fumes and move with agonising slowness along crowded strips of asphalt. While in Hell the protagonists are at a loss to understand the identity of a moustached man with a strange armband who speaks with a strong German accent, and why the most powerful demons tremble at the sight of him, or why he uses the \"ancient and honorable symbol of the fylfot\". Their alternative history never had a Nazi Germany. Another part of the book features a magical analogue to the counterculture of the 1960s, presented rather facetiously - reflecting Anderson's attitude to the real-life original. Given the supernatural metaphysics of this world, however, it takes the form of gnosticism, within a \"Johannine Church\" that is based on either an esoteric reading of the Gospel of John, or an alternative gnostic gospel version of that canonical New Testament book. In his werewolf form, Matuchek does not suffer many of the liabilities of a werewolf of folklore or, indeed, the werewolf of Anderson's Three Hearts and Three Lions. He remains himself while turning into a wolf, and is able to fully use his four-leg incarnation to fight various enemies; and in this magical world (unlike, for example, in the later created Harry Potter universe), there is no social stigma attached to lycanthropy. Dependence on the moon is lightly tossed aside with a comment that the necessary components of moonlight (specific frequencies of polarized light) have been isolated, and his Polaroid \"Were-flash\" lets him turn into a wolf or back to his human form at any time, its controls having been designed to be operable even with paws and no opposable thumbs. However, his invulnerability to silver is limited. Conservation of mass makes him a rather large wolf, although other weres in the book, taking far more drastic forms, have more serious problems. (A 600-pound weretiger has to be a 600-pound man in human form, again in order to not violate the Law of Conservation of Mass.)",

        "human_text": "The UK's adoption of digital TV and broadband has helped make it the fourth most digitally-savvy nation in Europe, according a report by Jupiter Research.\nBut the UK still lags in terms of broadband speeds compared to others. The most digitally sophisticated Europeans, in terms of use of digital goods such as mobiles, TV, net and cameras, are the Scandinavians. About 14 million households in the UK, 60%, have digital TV, according to the communications regulator Ofcom. The least digital of the European nations was Greece, in 17th position, according to the Digital Life Index.\nScandinavian countries Sweden, Denmark and Norway came out top in the report, but there were some differences in technology trends. \"The European Digital Life Index demonstrates that digital lifestyles are common today, but across Europe there is no single digital lifestyle,\" said Nate Elliott, Jupiter analyst. \"Consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries.\"\nAlthough there are differences between different European nations, the gap between them is closing, the report concluded. The trend for gadgets and technologies, such as digital video recorders (DVR), broadband, and video-on-demand will continue across Europe, he added. More than six million UK households now have broadband net. By the middle of 2005, it is estimated that 50% of all UK net users will be on broadband. Cable company NTL is trialling faster ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) broadband technology using ADSL2+ which can give speeds of 18Mbps compared to current speeds which are usually around 1Mbps or 2Mbps. BT is set to trial the technology later in the year. Super-fast broadband will be necessary to the delivery of services such as high-definition TV (HDTV) and video-on-demand, already very popular in France and other European countries.\nA separate survey by GMIPoll last week found that, globally, people's appetite for technology and gadgets continues unabated. The poll of 20,000 people in 20 countries found that 59% wanted more technology.\nThe computer was the \"must-have\" gadget for most people (75%). The TV took second place (67%), while the mobile was ranked in third position with 54%. Digital cameras were the most popular choice of gadget for 2005, said the survey, with nearly 40% choosing this over wireless, home printing and DVR technologies. However, only 25% of Britons said a digital camera would be their top gadget purchase of the year. Almost a quarter, 22%, said they would be buying some sort of wireless device. Forty-four percent said they would be buying something \"other\". This might include digital music players, or gaming devices. The Nintendo DS, Sony's PSP and Gizmondo all hit the shops in 2005, and the first of the next generation of games consoles, Xbox 2, is set to launch later this year. Jupiter Research's index is calculated using 40 different variables across net users, digital TV adoption, wireless and mobile, online activity, and digital devices.",
        "direct_prompt": "LONDON - The digital revolution is transforming Britain's television and internet industries, creating new opportunities for businesses and consumers alike. According to experts, this shift towards digital technology will continue to drive growth in the economy as more people access content online.\n\nThe rise of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has changed the way viewers consume entertainment, with many choosing to watch shows on-demand rather than tuning into traditional broadcast channels. At the same time, high-speed broadband connections have made it possible for households to enjoy smooth video streams without buffering or lagging.\n\nThis convergence between television and the internet has led to innovative products such as smart TVs that can connect directly to the web, allowing users to browse websites and stream videos without needing an additional device. In addition, companies are now offering bundled packages that combine TV and broadband services, making it easier for customers to get both at a discounted rate.\n\nAs demand grows for these digital offerings, so too does the need for skilled workers who can develop and maintain the necessary infrastructure. This has created job opportunities across various sectors, including engineering, programming, design, and customer service.\n\nWhile some critics worry about the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on jobs within the industry, others see these advancements as catalysts for further innovation. As machine learning algorithms improve, they could enable personalized recommendations based on individual viewing habits, leading to even better user experiences.\n\nOverall, the future looks bright for those working in the British media landscape as digitization continues to reshape the industry. With government support and investment in emerging technologies, there is potential for continued growth and innovation well into the next decade.",

        "human_text": "After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.<br/><br/>The story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. When he arrives in Japan, we learn that the first test of the Japanese army and its new weapons will be against a rebellious group of samurai who believe themselves to be in the service of the Emperor and Japan, but resist the Emperor's cabinet and the influence of western nations. In the power void left by a passive emperor, Japan seems poised to enter into a civil war against its own values, faith and honor. During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self-respect his own culture could never supply.<br/><br/>My interpretation of this journey is that Allgren has found a place and people that offer him redemption, where, in his own world, he can find none. But Allgren's is only a small part of the story - which ultimately revolves around what is right for Japan, for the subjectivity of a whole nation, and how to portray such a subject from its own perspective. Traditional Japan is treated with empathy here, not aggrandizing exaggeration, as some of the film's critics seem to suggest. This is not a film about what is objectively right and wrong, but a film about struggling to understand and empower tradition as a means to control and benefit from change. I find no grand moral statement here, but rather an intense, sympathetic, human drama with a strong sense of honor and sacrifice.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven. My highest recommendation.",
        "direct_prompt": "Tom Cruise's performance in The Last Samurai is nothing short of exceptional. He portrays Captain Nathan Algren, an American soldier who finds himself stranded in Japan after serving as a consultant to the Imperial Japanese Army during the Meiji Restoration. As he struggles to adapt to his new surroundings and reconcile his past with his present, we see him transform into a true samurai warrior under the guidance of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). \n\nDirector Edward Zwick expertly captures the beauty and brutality of 19th century Japan through stunning cinematography that showcases breathtaking landscapes alongside gruesome battle scenes. Meanwhile, the supporting cast delivers equally impressive performances, particularly Ken Watanabe whose nuanced portrayal of Katsumoto elevates the film beyond just another historical epic.\n\nOverall, The Last Samurai is both entertaining and thought-provoking, offering viewers a glimpse into a fascinating period of history while also exploring universal themes of culture shock, identity crisis, and redemption. It stands as one of Tom Cruise's best performances and should be required viewing for anyone interested in martial arts films or international cinema.",

        "human_text": "Fail-safes in nanotechnology are devices or features integrated with nanotechnology which, in the event of failure, respond in a way that will cause no harm, or at least a minimum of harm, to other devices or personnel. Fail-safe principles are governed by national standards and engineering practices, and are widely used in conventional engineering design. It is possible to scale down macro-scale fail-safe principles and devices for similar applications at the nano-scale. The use of fail-safes in nanotechnology applications supports social acceptance of those applications by reducing the risks to users; , there are both theoretical and practical ways to implement fail-safe designs in nanotechnology. A predominant challenge to the social acceptance of nanotechnology is concerned with the medical use of nanostructures in the human body. While any structure for medical use would be developed to be bio-compatible and harmless, sound engineering design must take into account all possibilities of failure. Thus, the design would include ways to manipulate the structures in the body in the event of failure.",
        "direct_prompt": "Fail-safes in nanotechnology refer to measures taken to prevent or mitigate potential risks associated with the development and use of nanoparticles. As nanotechnology continues to advance, it is essential to consider the possible consequences of unintended interactions between nanoparticles and biological systems, as well as the environment. Several fail-safe strategies have been proposed and implemented to ensure the responsible development and application of nanotechnology.\n\nOne approach to implementing fail-safes in nanotechnology involves designing nanoparticles with built-in degradation mechanisms that allow them to break down into non-toxic components once their intended function has been fulfilled. This can help minimize the potential for long-term toxicity and environmental persistence of nanoparticles. Additionally, researchers are working on developing methods to track and monitor nanoparticles throughout their lifecycle, from production to disposal, to better understand their behavior and potential impacts.[1]\n\nAnother important aspect of fail-safes in nanotechnology is transparency and open communication among scientists, policymakers, and the public. By sharing information about the potential risks and benefits of nanoparticle technologies, stakeholders can work together to identify and address concerns before they become major issues. In addition, regulatory frameworks have been established to guide the safe development and use of nanomaterials, ensuring that products containing nanoparticles undergo rigorous testing and evaluation prior to market release.[2]\n\nOverall, fail-safes in nanotechnology play a crucial role in promoting the responsible development and application of this emerging field. By addressing potential risks through research, design, and regulation, we can ensure that the benefits of nanotechnology are realized while minimizing any negative impact on human health and the environment.",

        "human_text": "China's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.\nThe curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.",
        "direct_prompt": "BEIJING - China's government has been taking steps to keep strict control over lending and borrowing in an effort to prevent a potential financial crisis caused by excessive debt accumulation. The country's leaders are concerned about rising levels of bad debt, which have led to defaults among companies that borrowed heavily to fund ambitious expansion plans.\n\nIn recent months, Beijing has ordered banks to increase their provisioning for non-performing loans while also reducing the amount of new credit being extended. These measures aim to reduce risk exposure within the banking sector and ensure that only viable projects receive funding.\n\nMoreover, regulators have introduced stricter rules governing local governments' ability to issue bonds, as well as limiting access to financing channels such as trust products or wealth management schemes – all with the goal of preventing further buildup of leverage throughout the economy.\n\nWhile these actions may slow down economic growth temporarily, many experts believe they are necessary to avoid a more severe crisis later on. They argue that curbing excesses in credit creation now will help maintain stability going forward and promote sustainable development.\n\nHowever, some critics contend that tightening credit conditions could exacerbate existing inequalities between different regions or sectors, leading to social unrest if not managed carefully. Others worry about possible negative impacts on consumption demand, given how reliant Chinese households are on bank loans to finance big-ticket items like homes or cars.\n\nDespite these concerns, however, most analysts agree that Beijing is likely to continue pursuing its conservative monetary policy approach at least until it becomes clear whether efforts to address debt risks are bearing fruit. In other words, any loosening of credit controls would probably depend on evidence showing that aggressive deleveraging strategies are successfully stabilizing financial markets and mitigating systemic vulnerabilities.",

The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\n\"We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\nGermany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.",

The decline was particularly sharp among manufacturers, who cited uncertainty surrounding Brexit and US tariffs on imports as major factors affecting their outlook.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel's government has been trying to reassure businesses and consumers that the country remains stable despite these challenges. However, some experts believe that unless there is a clear resolution to these issues soon, the downward trend could continue into next year.\n\nIn related news, carmaker BMW announced plans to cut thousands of jobs at its home base in Munich due to declining sales in China.

        "human_text": "Diagnostic overshadowing is the attribution of a person’s symptoms to a psychiatric problem when such symptoms actually suggest a comorbid condition.  Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when a healthcare professional assumes that a patient's complaint is due to their disability or coexisting mental health condition rather than fully exploring the cause of the patient's symptoms.  Often, once a patient has a confirmed diagnosis, there is a tendency to attribute all new behaviors or symptoms to the original diagnosis.   Diagnostic overshadowing increases the risk of further health complications and delay in accurate treatment.  An example of diagnostic overshadowing may be a patient being diagnosed with a psychiatric problem and prescribed medication due to head banging behavior, but the patient actually has communication challenges and can't express pain in their mouth due to a dental abscess. History\nThe term was first used to describe the underdiagnosis of mental illness in people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.  In recent years, the term has also been used when physical illnesses are overlooked in people with mental illness.",
        "direct_prompt": "Diagnostic overshadowing refers to a phenomenon in which an initial, more salient diagnosis or symptom dominates the clinical picture and leads to overlooking other potential diagnoses. This can occur when healthcare providers focus too heavily on one possible explanation for a patient's symptoms, leading them to miss alternative explanations that may be just as likely but less prominent in their minds. Diagnostic overshadowing is often associated with conditions that have distinctive or unusual presentations, such as rare diseases or those that share similar signs and symptoms with more common disorders. It can also arise from cognitive biases, such as anchoring effects or availability heuristics, where clinicians are influenced by prior knowledge or information they encounter early in the diagnostic process.[1] \n\nThe consequences of diagnostic overshadowing can include delayed or missed diagnoses, incorrect treatment plans, increased morbidity and mortality rates, and higher health care costs due to additional testing and consultations. To mitigate this issue, it is essential for physicians to adopt a comprehensive approach towards diagnosing patients while considering multiple differential diagnoses simultaneously rather than focusing solely on the most apparent possibility[2]. Additionally, incorporating structured approaches like checklists into medical practice has been shown to reduce errors caused by heuristic-based decision making including reducing instances ofdiagnostic overshadowing [3][4]. \n\nIn recent years there has been growing recognition of how frequently misdiagnosis occurs even among specialists who should know better. One study found that nearly half (46%) of cancer cases were initially diagnosed incorrectly; another revealed that up to 80%of heart attacks go undiagnosed until after significant damage has occurred because doctors fail to recognize warning signs[5][6]. These statistics highlight not only how pervasive inaccurate diagnostics can be within medicine today but also underscore why improving our understanding about factors contributing toward these mistakes –such asheuristic reliance/cognitive bias–should remain top priorities moving forward.[7]",

The book is told from four main perspectives: Elizabeth I's; William Cecil's, the queen's main advisor; Robert Dudley, the queen's favourite; and Amy Robsart's, who is Robert Dudley's wife. Robert Dudley returns to court upon Elizabeth's coronation, and Amy hopes that his ambitions will not get him into trouble. During Mary's reign, Dudley was kept in the Tower of London, his father and brother were executed, and another brother died in Calais. However, her hopes for the quiet life soon die, as Elizabeth and Robert become closer and more intimate. Elizabeth has inherited a bankrupt and rebellious country, in turmoil as a result of the previous two monarch's reigns. Her advisor, William Cecil, warns that she will only survive if she marries a strong prince, but the only man that Elizabeth desires is her childhood friend, and married man, Robert Dudley. Robert is sure that he can reclaim his destiny at Elizabeth's side. And as queen and courtier fall in love, Dudley begins to contemplate the impossible - setting aside his loving wife to marry the young Elizabeth...",

        "human_text": "The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said.\nContent on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster, the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.\n\"The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,\" he said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.\nSome studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC. Head of the division, Andrew Burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. \"How risque can I be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely I can push it to the limit,\" he said.\nIn fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them \"mere conduits\" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net. The BBC's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said.\nOne of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Mr Ayers. As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of \"impossible to regulate\" and \"just apply offline laws online\". In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. \"If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. There is no watershed on the net,\" said Mr Burke.",
        "direct_prompt": "The debate over regulating the internet has been ongoing for years, with many arguing that it is impossible to control such a vast and global platform. However, experts are now suggesting that while complete regulation may be difficult, some form of oversight can still be implemented.\n\nAccording to a report by the European Union's executive arm, new laws could be introduced which would give governments more power to regulate content on social media platforms and search engines. This comes after several high-profile cases where online content has been used to spread hate speech or fake news.\n\nWhile critics argue that any attempt at regulation will stifle innovation and free expression, proponents believe that something must be done to protect users from harmful content. The EU report suggests that self-regulation by companies might not be enough, and that legislation could be an option if tech giants fail to take action against illegal activity on their platforms.\n\nHowever, implementing such regulations would require international cooperation as the internet knows no borders. It remains to be seen whether countries will be able to come to a consensus on how best to balance freedom and safety when it comes to the world wide web.",

The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.<br/><br/>\"Kong: Skull Island\" is a brainless adventure with several stupidities. For example, the number of helicopters in the beginning of the journey of Randa, Conrad and Packard is totally incompatible with the size of their ship.

These proportions were used to govern the musical composition in the melodic theme, the sonic texture, and even the pace of development of the piece.

Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\nYukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection.\nLifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position, analysts said.\nAnalysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. \"Do we have an ability to influence what happens? We think we do,\" said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman. \"The litigation risks are real,\" said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

        "human_text": "(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was \"dazed and exhausted\" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)<br/><br/>Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \"wowed\" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  \"Heck\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \"dumbing down\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?",
        "direct_prompt": "\"A Bug's Life\" is an animated masterpiece that will captivate audiences young and old with its charming characters, heartwarming story, and stunning visuals. The film follows the journey of a small community of ants who are struggling to survive against a group of greedy grasshoppers led by the ruthless Hopper. However, when one little ant named Flik stumbles upon a colony of warrior bugs, he enlists their help in order to save his home and defeat the evil hoppers once and for all.\n\nThe voice acting in this film is top-notch, with Tom Wilkinson delivering a particularly standout performance as the villainous Hopper. The animation is beautiful, bringing the world of the insects to life in vivid detail. And the storyline? It's sweet, funny, and full of action-packed moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nOverall, \"A Bug's Life\" is a must-see for anyone who loves great storytelling, breathtaking animation, and unforgettable characters. It's a true classic that never fails to entertain, no matter how many times you watch it.",

        "human_text": "Rodrigo Vélaz (died June 1144) was the \"count of Galicia, who held Sarria\" according to the near-contemporary Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris. During his long public career he was the dominant figure in mountainous eastern Galicia while the House of Traba dominated its western seaboard. He served under three monarchs—Alfonso VI, Urraca, and Alfonso VII—and was loyal to all of them, never figuring in any rebellion. The contemporary Historia compostellana is a valuable source for his life, since there are no aristocratic archives surviving in Spain from this period. Rodrigo's career must be pieced together from the few references in the chronicles and the (copies of) charters preserved in various ecclesiastical archives. He was a son of Count Vela Ovéquiz and Aldonza Muñoz, daughter of Count Muño Fernández and Elvira. Rodrigo married Urraca Álvarez, daughter of Álvar Fáñez and Mayor Pérez, a daughter of Pedro Ansúrez. Rodrigo and his wife were descended on all sides from the highest ranks of the nobility of León and Castile. The couple had three daughters—Aldonza, Berenguela, and Elvira—and one son, Álvaro Rodríguez, who was later a count like his father. On 6 August 1130 Rodrigo and Urraca made a donation to the Cathedral of Lugo, their first recorded act as husband and wife.",
        "direct_prompt": "Rodrigo Vélaz was a Spanish conquistador who played an important role in the conquest of Peru. He served as the lieutenant to Francisco Pizarro, the leader of the expedition, and took part in several key battles against the Inca Empire. \n\nVélaz was born in Santiago de Compostela in Spain in 1465. Little is known about his early life, but he likely received a education and training in warfare before joining Pizarro's expedition to South America. In 1532, he participated in the Battle of Cajamarca, where Pizarro defeated the Inca emperor Atahualpa. After Atahualpa's execution, Vélaz helped to secure the city of Cuzco for the Spaniards. \n\nIn 1536, Vélaz led a group of conquistadors on an exploratory mission into the Amazon rainforest. During this journey, they encountered numerous indigenous tribes and fought several battles against them. Despite facing many challenges, including illness and lack of supplies, Vélaz successfully completed the mission and returned to Cuzco with valuable information about the region. \n\nLater in his career, Vélaz became involved in a power struggle between different factions of conquistadors in Peru. He sided with Diego de Almagro, who was eventually executed by order of the Viceroy of Peru. As a result, Vélaz fell out of favor with the Spanish Crown and was forced to leave Peru. \n\nDespite his controversial reputation, Rodrigo Vélaz remains an important figure in the history of the Conquest of Peru. His leadership skills and military expertise were crucial to the success of the Spanish invasion, and his explorations of the Amazon rainforest paved the way for further colonization of the region.",

        "direct_prompt": "In this study, we propose a Bayesian dense inverse searching algorithm for real-time stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery. The proposed method utilizes a probabilistic approach to efficiently match corresponding points between two images captured by stereoscopic cameras. By incorporating prior knowledge about the scene and using an iterative search strategy, our algorithm achieves accurate and robust performance even under challenging conditions such as low light or rapid motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Our contribution paves the way towards more reliable and precise computer-assisted interventions in minimal access surgeries.",

Upon opening it, he discovers that it is a shoebox containing thirteen cassette tapes recorded by the late Hannah Baker, his classmate and emotionally damaged crush who recently committed suicide by taking a handful of pills. The tapes were initially mailed to one classmate with instructions to pass them from one student to another, in the style of a chain letter. On the tapes, Hannah explains to thirteen people how they played a role in her death, by giving thirteen reasons explaining why she took her life. Hannah has given a second set of tapes to one of their classmates, the identity of whom Clay later discovers, and warns the people on the tapes that if they do not pass them on, the second set will be leaked to the entire student body. This could lead to the public embarrassment and shame of certain people, while others could face physical harassment charges or jail time. Through the audio narrative, Hannah reveals her pain and suffering and her spiral into depression that ultimately leads to her death. She lists her first crush,a former friend, a peeping Tom, a liar, a goof who takes advantage of her, a hater, a thief who steals her poems, a member of the list that already passed, a cheerleader who crashes into a stop sign, a guy she had a sexual encounter with, the guidance counselor, and Clay himself.

The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland's binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been \"obscured\" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.\nThe one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: \"I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. \"If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it.\" However, he added that \"perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage\".\nMr MacDonell said: \"I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. \"But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.\" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland's fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: \"I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.\n\"We don't want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. \"This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.\" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were \"off the mark\", they were bound to \"come back and bite him\". He added: \"Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. \"I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.\"\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his \"ill-judged comment\" and withdraw it immediately. In a furious response, the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. He told Ms Sturgeon: \"It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I 'should encourage young people to get drunk'. \"That is completely untrue. Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.\"",
        "direct_prompt": "A senior government minister has faced criticism after suggesting that discussing alcohol consumption is a way to avoid talking about more important issues. In an interview, the minister was asked about the rising rates of binge drinking among young people and responded by saying that it was \"better to talk about what people are drinking rather than addressing the underlying problems.\"\n\nCritics have argued that this response trivializes the issue of alcohol abuse and demonstrates a lack of commitment to tackling the problem head-on. One opposition MP described the comment as \"shocking\" and called for stronger measures to be put in place to protect young people from the harm caused by excessive drinking.\n\nThe Minister's remarks come at a time when there is growing concern over the impact of alcohol on society, with recent studies linking heavy drinking to a range of health problems including liver disease, cancer and mental illness. Campaigners have been calling for stricter regulations on the sale and promotion of alcoholic beverages, but so far no significant changes have been made.\n\nIn light of these concerns, it remains to be seen whether the Minister's comments will lead to any meaningful action being taken to address the issue of alcohol misuse, or if they will simply serve as a distraction from the real problems facing society.",

Many recipes call for boiling, but this can waterlog the gnocchi. You can bake the potatoes, but this takes too long. I microwave them. Make sure to score or pierce the skins. This not only allows moisture to escape, but also prevents them from exploding inside the microwave. 2. As soon as the potatoes are tender (you can easily pass a small knife through), take them out and remove the skins. I use a clean towel to hold the potato so I dont burn myself, and use a paring knife to peel the skins away. 3. Rice the potatoes. (If you didnt read the recipe all the way and now are wondering what to do because you dont have a potato ricer, dont worry. You can mash the potatoes really well, and then fluff them up with a fork. The potato ricer is better because it adds air, making fluffier potatoes, but it isnt essential.) 4. Add the egg and stir quickly so that the hot potatoes do not cook the egg. Add the salt and pepper and keep mixing until incorporated. 5. Add the flour one tablespoon at a time. Mix until the flour is incorporated. Keep adding spoonfuls of flour until the mixture looks like bread dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured counter and keep kneading until the dough is not sticky, adding flour as needed. (You may need more or less depending on the moisture level of the potatoes, the size of the potatoes, the size of the egg, the weather outside, etc.) 6. Pull off a ball of dough (1/4 cup) and roll it into a rope about as thick as a pretzel rod. Cup the rope into 1/4 to 1/2-inch pieces. Take each piece and roll it on a gnocchi board (or the back of a fork) to create the classic lines for the gnocchi look. These lines not only make the gnocchi look professional, but also allow the sauce to stick. 7. Freeze or cook. a. To cook, roll them into a pot of salted boiling water. When they all float, wait another minute and then drain them. b. To freeze, place the gnocchi on a baking sheet, put them into the freezer until hard and then transfer to a freezer bag. To cook from frozen, it will obviously take a bit longer, but the instructions are the same. 8. Sauce them with your favorite sauce. Tomato works well.

Annaïg Hoïnart, a seventeen-year-old Breton girl, and her Argonian friend Mere-Glim, escape from Black Marsh just ahead of Umbriel. They witnessed Umbriel moving toward the city, and after Glim is overcome by an urge to run back to the city, Annaïg During their journey, Sul and Attrebus met a group of Khajiit who joined them. Sul explained to Attrebus that he intended to short-cut through Oblivion to beat Umbriel to Vvardenfell. He explains that Umbriel was undoubtedly a product of Vuhon, the man who had engineered the ingenium, the device that had kept the Ministry of Truth in place in Vivec's absence. He killed Sul's love, Ilzheven, and caused the Ministry of Truth to crash into Vvardenfell, in turn causing Red Mountain to erupt and destroy the entire island. Sul and Vuhon both were thrown into Oblivion, and a being named Umbra took that opportunity of the barrier between worlds opening to throw a sword, also called Umbra, into Tamriel, preventing Clavicus Vile from imprisoning him in it again. Sul is looking for the sword to destroy Umbriel. After nearly being recaptured, Sul opens a portal to Oblivion and he, Treb, and the Khajiit entered the planes of Oblivion, traveling through different planes, noticing the differences through the pain of the transitions. The path was interrupted in Hircine's plane, and Sul guided the party through Oblivion as Hircine and his drivers hunted them. One of the Khajiit was killed during the chase, and those remaining stayed behind at the end of the course to delay Hircine from reaching Attrebus and Sul. Attrebus and Sul exited Oblivion directly into the ruined Vivec City. There, Sul explained that Azura told him he'd find Umbra here, and that it must be what Vuhon was after. He found that the place where Umbra should have been was gone, and spoke with the spirit of Ilzheven. He questioned her about Umbra, and she told him that Dunmer found it and took it north, toward the Sea of Ghosts. As Sul wandered the ruined city, Attrebus kept an eye out for Umbriel and opened Coo, finding Annaïg looking back at him. She told him that she couldn't wait for him, that she and Glim would use her flying potions and leave Umbriel. When she closed her locket, a few moments later Attrebus saw the bottom of Umbriel poking out from the bottom of the clouds, heading toward them and very close. Annaïg, working in Toel's kitchen on Umbriel, received a bucket of ingredients from a skraw that contained her locket, and inside it a message from Glim. She responded to Glim’s note and they met the following midnight, at the dock. They consumed flying potions Annaïg had made, and begin to fly away from Umbriel, only to find that they had become like the other residents of the city; if they traveled too far from Umbriel, they began to lose their substance. Though Colin had been pulled from the Attrebus investigation, he continued investigating. The last person Gulan had spoken to, Letine Arese, an assistant to the Prime Minister, made her way deep into the Market District and entered a building, and Colin climbed a nearby building in order to reach a third-story window. He entered a small empty bedroom and made his way downstairs until he heard the voices of Arese and a male. She seemed concerned that the \"job\" was not accomplished as it should have been. Colin learned that a courier brought news to the Emperor that the Prince lived. As their conversation escalated, among the screams of men it seemed that Arese changed form into a sort of beast. It moved past him, up the stairs, then a few moments later came back down and exited through the door. The building was burning, and Colin escaped through the window. Unable to search the house, he wondered why Arese wanted the Prince dead, and why she didn't accomplish the task herself. Sul was drawn back to Attrebus by his screams, to find Umbriel nearly upon them. They attempted to move back to their entry position, but were transported to Umbriel, suspended in a type of spiderweb-like net in front of Vuhon. As they spoke, Sul accused Vuhon of murdering his love, Ilzheven, and destroying Vvardenfell; Vuhon contested that it was actually Sul that did that. It was revealed that Ilzheven had a very special type of soul, and Vuhon was using her to power the ingenium, to hold the Ministry of Truth aloft over Vivec City. When Sul freed her, it sent the Ministry of Truth crashing into Vivec City, killing Ilzheven and throwing Sul and Vuhon into Oblivion. Vuhon also revealed that he had an ally inside the Imperial Palace, the person that was trying to have Attrebus killed. He said he'd need the Imperial City, specifically the White Gold Tower, and offered Attrebus the chance to convince his father to back down. Through his close relationship with Oblivion, Sul shattered Vuhon's glass world by summoning a monstrous daedra. While Vuhon was distracted, Attrebus tried to attack from behind, but was discovered by Vuhon and trapped once more. At the last moment, Sul sprang to the prince's side and said \"Not now,\" before laying a hand on his shoulder and pulling them both into another part of Oblivion. The book ends with Glim and Annaïg back on Umbriel, defeated. They spent a few hours together before saying their goodbyes, and Annaïg headed back to the kitchen. She promised Glim that, while all they could do was continue to move forward, eventually they would be free. She then resolved to become stronger and more ambitious in order to survive.",

Just like in Trois Couleurs Bleu, the music of La Double vie de Véronique is very indivisible from the film: the visual and the auditive form a united whole and also elements of it are directly part of the story. And when it comes to music made for film, Zbigniew Preisner's powerful score for this one is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>When there is little dialogue, it is not just the images and expressions on Irène Jacob's face that tells the story, but also the powerful strains of music intermingled with it.<br/><br/>Even with just these elements in place, it would be a movie worth seeing, though obviously a narrative based in little extent on dialogue and with less emphasis on a clear-cut story than your average American movie is unfortunately lost on some of the earlier commentators.<br/><br/>And even this seemingly sparingly laid out narrative reveals itself to the careful watcher to be a rich tapestry of symbols, metaphors and hidden meanings. Kiéslowski, just as in his other movies, demands participation of the viewer, and the one who expects passive entertainment has found the wrong film to watch.<br/><br/>Krzysztof never liked discussing meaning when it came to his movies, but liked keeping that up to the viewers, and few other directors have ever been able to lay out more food for thought and fruitful interpretation than him.<br/><br/>I saw the Three Colours trilogy before seeing Véronique, and the many similarities, both musical and in visual narrative, makes it feel like it almost belongs together with those three to form a quartet. In some ways it has more in common with Blue than Red and White do. <br/><br/>Had Juliette Binoche also been cast in the role of Véronique, as I understand that Krzysztof originally had intended, the similarities had been even greater. She was, however, occupied with shooting Les Amants du Pont-Neuf at the time I believe, and so Krzysztof opted for the less experienced Irène. I don't think the film is any worse for it: she is brilliant, and not just a pretty face as some people put it, but a very intelligent and aware actress as anyone who has seen her interview for the Red DVD release should discover if they haven't already.<br/><br/>In short: a wonderful film, wonderful music, great acting.

As\nmanual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been\nextensive research effort to automatically segment the neurons to help guide\nand eventually replace manual tracing. Until recently, there has been\ncomparatively less research on automatically detecting the actual synapses\nbetween neurons. This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several\nfactors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a\nconnectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating\nsynapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in\ndetermining connections.\n  However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a\nsufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has\nimproved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more\nsignificant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get\nworse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we\naddress this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect\npre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,\npre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive\nNetwork, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features\nconditioned on the local segmentation.\n  This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages\nadvances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for\npolyadic synapse detection.

        "human_text": "I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.<br/><br/>The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.<br/><br/>What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.<br/><br/>I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.<br/><br/>10/10",
        "direct_prompt": "\"I have seen 'The Game' multiple times, and each viewing is as thrilling as the first. The acting is superb, with Michael Douglas delivering a captivating performance that showcases his range as an actor. Deborah Kara Unger also shines in her role, creating a complex character that complements Douglasy's portrayal of Nicholas Van Orton. David Fincher's direction brings the story to life, crafting a tense atmosphere filled with suspenseful moments that keep you on the edge of your seat. Overall, this film is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates great storytelling and top-notch performances.\"",

Then, we have considered interacting model between $F(R,T)$\ngravity and modified Chaplygin gas. The novelty of this model is that the\nUniverse includes both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a\nChaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained\nFriedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy.\nBy employing interacting model we considered the total energy density and the\ntotal pressure of Universe as the combination of components of dark energy and\nChaplygin gas. Subsequently, we reconstructed the model by an origin of a\nscalar field entitled quintessence model with a field potential. The field\npotential has been calculated in terms of free parameters of $F(R,T)$ gravity\nand modified Chaplygin gas. In what follows, we used a parametrization, and the\ncosmological parameters have been written in terms of redshift $z$. Next, we\nplotted cosmological parameters with respect to three variable of cosmic time,\nredshift $z$ and $e$-folding number $N=ln(a)$, and the figures showed us an\naccelerated expansion of Universe. Also, we have described the scenario in\nthree status early time, late time and future time by $e$-folding number.\nFinally, the stability of scenario has been investigated by a useful function\nnamed sound speed, and the graph of sound speed versus $e$-folding number has\nbeen showed us that there is the stability in late time.\n",

The study also involves Modified Chaplygin Gas as an alternative cosmological model. This combination allows us to investigate how these two models interact in different cosmic eras: radiation-,matter -and dark age-. We analyze various cosmographic parameters such as Hubble parameter H(z), deceleration q(z) and jerk j(z) at hand of observational data from type Ia supernovae (SNeIa).

The central character of the novel is Kuki, a Hindu woman from India who falls (and then rises) in love with a Muslim artist from Pakistan . The unusualness of the socio-cultural background of these two characters is delicately portrayed by Sahoo in a sensitive and convincing manner. Readers become familiar with the two sets of roles that Kuki plays; that of a lover and that of a wife. Sahoo subtly balances these two roles and at the same time, highlights the superiority of a wife in a pragmatic world. But the novel is not merely a love story. Though love is a part of the novel, it deals with a much broader topic: the providence of a woman in India. At the same time, it also portrays a story of how a perverted man, over time, becomes a perfect man. It also delves into the relationship between the ‘state’ and the ‘individual’ and comes to the conclusion that ‘the state’ represents the moods and wishes of a ruler and hence, ‘the state’ actually becomes a form of ‘an individual.’ Additionally, it takes a broader look at terrorism and state-sponsored anarchism.",

I pulled out the brush and she immediately went into her crate and cowered. I would LOVE to get a flying pig just to blow out her hair but she gates my reg hair dryer. Our former shepherd/collie only had blow outs because after a pet store chain groomer literally brushed her so hard, her body was full of scabs. Blow out grooming was the only thing she would tolerate. I took my border to a good professional but she was terrified and cried. So not doing that again. Any suggestions on how to get this kid groomed? Is the flying pig quieter than a hairdryer?",

        "human_text": "Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.<br/><br/>Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!",

He later moved to Germany and played there from 1988 to 2000. Internationally Sherven played for the Canadian national team at the 1983 World Junior and senior World Championships, as well as the 1988 Winter Olympics. Playing career\nSherven was born in Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan and raised in Mankota, Saskatchewan. He was selected by the Edmonton Oilers in the tenth round of the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. He played three seasons of collegiate hockey for the University of North Dakota from 1981–84, including the championship team of the 1982 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament. He also played for the Canada national junior hockey team that won the bronze medal at the 1983 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and the senior national team that won the bronze medal at the 1983 World Ice Hockey Championships only four months later.

Prior to entering politics, he worked as an educator and advocate for social justice causes. In 2011, he co-founded Pride at Work Canada, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ rights within trade unions.\n\nIn 2014, Sherven ran for election to the House of Commons as part of Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party. During his campaign, he emphasized the need for affordable housing and stronger protections for renters. He also advocated for greater access to healthcare and education, particularly for marginalized communities.\n\nAs a member of parliament, Sherven sat on several committees, including the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. He also chaired the All-Party Caucus on Homelessness and Affordable Housing, which brought together MPs from across party lines to address these issues.\n\nDuring his time in office, Sherven introduced several private members' bills aimed at improving conditions for low-income Canadians. One such bill would have created a national strategy to prevent homelessness among youth, while another sought to improve accessibility standards for people with disabilities. Although none of these bills were passed into law during his tenure, they helped shape the debate around poverty and inequality in Canada.\n\nDespite being reelected in the 2015 federal election, Sherven announced in 2018 that he would not be seeking reelection in the upcoming campaign. Citing personal reasons, he resigned from parliament effective February 1, 2019. Since leaving politics, he has remained active in advocacy efforts focused on social justice and human rights.",

        "human_text": "For every icon, there is an unknown predecessor who paves the way. Before there was Kurt Cobain, there was Ian Curtis, lead singer of the post-punk band, Joy Division. 27 years after his tragic death, Curtis' incredible contribution to music is finally being recognized in Anton Corbijn's film, \"Control.\" It's only fitting that Corbijn serve as director since it was his early photographs of Joy Division that reflected the band's dark, introspective songs. Corbijn went on to photograph and direct videos for such musical greats as U2, David Bowie, Depeche Mode, R.E.M. and Metallica.<br/><br/>With his first feature film, Corbijn avoids the pitfalls of many music video directors who inundate us with flashy and unnecessary edits and camera angles. Instead, he lets the stark black and white of the film tell the story of a lead singer tortured by epilepsy, guilt, depression and suicidal thoughts. The use of black and white also captures the factory town of Manchester, England in the late 1970s, a city crumbling under industrial and economic stress. Manchester has since rebounded and is once again thriving.<br/><br/>Curtis is played by relative newcomer, Sam Riley, who's quiet and unassuming approach portrays an artist inspired by his heroes, David Bowie and Iggy Pop. At a chance meeting following a Sex Pistols concert, Curtis bonds with three fellow musicians to form the band.<br/><br/>As Joy Division begins to flourish, Ian's relationship with his young wife, Deborah, continues to distance itself. Academy Award nominee, Samantha Morton plays the confused wife trying to understand her husband's depressed soul. The film is based on Deborah Curtis' autobiography, \"Touching From A Distance\", so it comes as a surprise that Morton's character does not have more scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>The key to Control is understanding Curtis' depression, which the film accomplishes to near perfection. As he battles epilepsy, the young singer lives in constant fear that his next seizure will be his last. His only option is to swallow a daily cocktail of prescription drugs with side effects so terrible, that most of us would rather tempt fate than endure the aftermath of the pills.<br/><br/>Ian's spirit is also tortured by overwhelming guilt brought on by an extra-marital affair with a part-time journalist, played by Romanian-born Alexandra Maria Lara.<br/><br/>The most telling scene comes when Ian records an in-studio track for the song \"Isolation.\" While Curtis stoically sings into the microphone, his band mates are distracted with the normal banter that typically occurs in a studio.<br/><br/>\"Mother, I tried, please believe me. I'm doing the best that I can. I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through. I'm ashamed of the person I am.\" The lyrics seem to fall on deaf ears except for those of the sound engineer who refers to it as \"genius.\" But Ian's brilliance is also a desperate cry for help ignored by everyone in the studio.<br/><br/>The 27-year-old Riley does an excellent job of capturing Curtis' aloofness on stage. Singers such as Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain and even the early years of Michael Stipe would often drift into the moment of the song. But when Curtis performed, he immersed himself into his own world where the music simply served as the soundtrack. Riley skillfully draws us into Ian's dark world with a range of subtle head movements and facial expressions to a whirling explosion of arm gyrations that came to personify the singer's stage performances.<br/><br/>Overwhelmed with grief, shame and depression, Ian finally succumbs to his demons at the young age of 23. He left behind a wife, a child and a musical legacy that is finally receiving its just rewards nearly three decades later.<br/><br/>For those looking for a story solely about Joy Division, Control may not be for you. But for those seeking an intuitive perspective into the anguished spirit of one of the most influential alternative bands in history, you will certainly find it in this depressing but incredibly beautiful film.",

He is known for his socialist leanings and disapproval of Bulgaria's prime minister Boiko Borisov. One of the country's top rap artists in the 1990s and the early 2000s, his career has been waning ever since his partner, Ivan Glavchev (Vanko 1), was sentenced in 2003 to 12 years in prison for running an organization that exported Bulgarian prostitutes, including minors, to France, Spain, Belgium and Italy. He openly supported Bulgaria's last socialist-led government, whose decision to appoint a media tycoon known for his links to organized crime as head of the national security agency sparked nationwide protests against the Oresharski cabinet. He also provoked indignation by calling Bulgaria's former Finance Minister, Simeon Dyankov, \"Jewish scum\" in 2013. The following day he published an apology to the Jewish community in Bulgaria, on his official Facebook page. Music career \nKnown as \"the Hammer\", after MC Hammer, he had a group called Hamburger 1 with which he caught some attention. But his success came with Gumeni Glavi (Rubber Heads) when their debut album sold over 120 000 copies in 1994 which is equal to a four times platinum certification from BAMP (Bulgarian Association of Music Producers). Their second album Second-Hand Tires didn't sell as well. After these two albums in 1997 Dj Dido D was introduced to the group and the albums that followed were instant classics in Bulgarian Hip Hop. The albums were called For More Money and For Even More Money. After their success, Gumeni Glavi performed over 200 concerts in Bulgaria but after disputes within the band they split up and Sha began his solo career.",

Previous approaches tackle this problem by\nimplicit feature interaction and fusion between visual and linguistic\nmodalities in a one-stage manner. However, human tends to solve the referring\nproblem in a progressive manner based on informative words in the expression,\ni.e., first roughly locating candidate entities and then distinguishing the\ntarget one. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension\n(CMPC) scheme to effectively mimic human behaviors and implement it as a CMPC-I\n(Image) module and a CMPC-V (Video) module to improve referring image and video\nsegmentation models. For image data, our CMPC-I module first employs entity and\nattribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered\nby the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the\ntarget entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by spatial graph\nreasoning. For video data, our CMPC-V module further exploits action words\nbased on CMPC-I to highlight the correct entity matched with the action cues by\ntemporal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC, we also introduce a simple\nyet effective Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to integrate the\nreasoned multimodal features corresponding to different levels in the visual\nbackbone under the guidance of textual information. In this way, multi-level\nfeatures can communicate with each other and be mutually refined based on the\ntextual context. Combining CMPC-I or CMPC-V with TGFE can form our image or\nvideo version referring segmentation frameworks and our frameworks achieve new\nstate-of-the-art performances on four referring image segmentation benchmarks\nand three referring video segmentation benchmarks respectively.",

        "human_text": "The official re-election site of President George W Bush is blocking visits from overseas users for \"security reasons\".\nThe blocking began early on Monday so those outside the US and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it. But keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective. Many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses.\nThe policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website. Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign said: \"The measure was taken for security reasons.\" He declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy. The barring of non-US visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place. In early October a so-called \"denial of service\" attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of PCs. The attack made the site unusable for about five hours.\nAbout the same time the web team of the Bush-Cheney campaign started using the services of a company called Akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic. Akamai uses a web-based tool called EdgeScape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based. Typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages, video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic. Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. Readers of the Boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the George W Bush domain name. Ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site. There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site. The site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US. Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site.\nThe international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites.\nNetcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney have failed. By contrast Netcraft's four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems. Data gathered by Netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack. Mike Prettejohn, Netcraft president, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November. He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. Managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. However, simply blocking non-US visitors also means that Americans overseas are barred too. Most American soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the US military's own portion of the net. Akamai declined to comment, saying it could not talk about customer websites.",
        "direct_prompt": "The US government has blocked access to several websites linked to al Qaeda and other terrorist organisations in response to last week's deadly attack on the USS Cole anniversary. The move comes as part of President George W. Bush's ongoing war on terror, aimed at disrupting the online activities of extremist groups that use the internet to recruit members and spread propaganda.\n\nAccording to officials, the decision was made after it was discovered that some of the sites were used by the attackers who killed 17 American sailors aboard the destroyer in Yemen on 12 October 2000. The action is seen as an attempt to prevent similar attacks from happening again.\n\nIn addition to blocking the domains, the Department of Justice also filed criminal charges against three individuals associated with the websites for providing material support to terrorists. The defendants are accused of operating servers located in the United States that hosted content related to jihad and violent Islamist ideology.\n\nWhile civil liberties advocates have raised concerns about potential violations of free speech and due process, the White House defended the actions as necessary to protect national security. It remains unclear how long the website blockade will remain in place or whether more measures may be taken in the future.",

Her performance alone is worth watching the movie for. But unlike show-stoppers like Marissa Tomei in \"My Cousin Vinnie,\" merely shines the brightest light in a luminescent cast.<br/><br/>The cinematography was innovative, but not distractingly so-- \"Girl Interupted\" shines primarily for its dramatic power, not as a mind-blowing work of art. It will not explode your vision of the mundane world in the same way that \"American Beauty\" might, but it will certainly probe you to question your way of seeing the world-- at least psychologically.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder challenged my preconception of her, and proved herself as more than a pretty-girl. Her performance was convincing as Suzanna, a confused high-school graduate who is eloquent and insightful on paper yet unable to a rticulate her own desperate melancholy.<br/><br/>The movie takes place primarily in the women's ward of a mental institution and follows the dynamic friendship between Lisa (Jolie's character) and Suzanna. Lisa is a kinetic, dynamic personality who cuts right to the \"truth\" of things. Her \"truth\" knows no boundaries and she is a controlling person prone to violence. Her piercing insights about people and social recklessness led to her to be institutionalized as a sociopath.<br/><br/>This is not a depressing film. Rather, it is suprisingly life-affirming. Not cloying, not sacherine, but not inpenetrably dark, either.  Anyone seeking an angst-ridden portrayal of abuses in mental institutions should check out Jack Nicholson's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest.\"<br/><br/>This film has little of the violent anger of that old classic. Yet it does echo some of the ebulience, the defiance of authority and embracing of freedom at sometimes incalculable cost.<br/><br/>Performances by Whoppie Goldberg (in a serious and nuanced role) and Vanessa Redgrave were excellent, as expected.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few holywood gimmicks, predictable cuts and music, this is a nearly flawless film. Dead-on dramatically, and excellently scripted and based on an eloquent true-story by Suzana Keisen, this movie offers a glimpse of one intensely personal experience of truth. Without the quotation marks, dark cynicism, or pretensions that revelation so frequently entails.",

The film delves deep into the complexities of these conditions while also highlighting the importance of support systems and self-discovery in overcoming them. Each character's journey is unique yet interconnected, creating a powerful narrative that resonates with viewers on multiple levels. The performances are stellar across the board, particularly Winona Ryder as Susanna Kaysen and Angelina Jolie as Lisa Rowe.

This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep\nrepresentation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method\nconsists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature\nrepresentations of training patches from a target image using joint\nunsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations\ngenerated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as\nsupervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D\nconvolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply\nk-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project\ncluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented\nimage. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens\nscanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The automatic segmentation\nof pathological regions in micro-CT could further contribute to the\npathological examination process. Hence, we aim to automatically divide each\nimage into the regions of invasive carcinoma, noninvasive carcinoma, and normal\ntissue. Our experiments show the potential abilities of unsupervised deep\nrepresentation learning for medical image segmentation.",
        "direct_prompt": "This study presents an unsupervised segmentation approach for 3D medical images using a combination of clustering and deep representation learning. The proposed method utilizes k-means clustering to group similar voxels together, followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn discriminative features from these clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid approach achieves competitive performance compared to supervised methods while requiring no manual annotation, making it a promising tool for automated image analysis in clinical settings.",

        "human_text": "The digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories, according to Carly Fiorina, chief of technology giant Hewlett Packard.\nThe job of firms such as HP now, she said in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. She said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. CES showcases 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. \"The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible,\" she told delegates. \"Revolution has always been about giving power to the people.\" She added: \"The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell.\" Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. Crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device, such as a digital camera, to others, such as portable media players. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said.\nMs Fiorina's talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle, fashion and personalisation, something she sees as key to what people want.\nSpecial guest, singer Gwen Stefani, joined her on-stage to promote her own range of HP digital cameras which Ms Stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by Japanese youth culture. The digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer, are based on the HP 607 model. The emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year's CES, with tiny, wearable MP3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in Europe early this year. The service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content, like a track's ringtone, simultaneously. The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.\nAmong the other new products she showcased was the Digital Media Hub, a big upgrade to HP's Digital Entertainment Centre. Coming out in the autumn in the US, the box is a networked, high-definition TV, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and DVD recorder. It has a removable hard drive cartridge, memory card slots, and Light Scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised DVD labels and covers. It is designed to contain all a household's digital media, such as pre-recorded TV shows, pictures, videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. The hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the PC so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. Research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day, equating to 94 billion a year. Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. Media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. Ms Fiorina was one of several keynote speakers, who also included Microsoft chief Bill Gates, to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. In a separate announcement during the keynote speech, Ms Fiorina said that HP would be partnering MTV to replace this year's MTV Asia music award. MTV's Asia Aid will be held in Bangkok on 3 February, and is aimed at helping to raise money for the Asian tsunami disaster.",

As a young, aspiration-filled woman myself, Lawrence's portrayal of Joy makes me feel like I can take on the world (which is dream that current American society consistently crushes on the daily). Lawrence's deadpan stares as she struts in and out of offices along with her turning point bathroom haircut, confirm that both Jennifer and Joy are a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>\"Joy\" also possesses a subtle humor, although many reviews seem to deny its existence. The purposefully over the top soap opera scenes obsessed over by bed-bound Terry (played by Virginia Madsen) are just enough to raise the otherwise dark tone. <br/><br/>Lawrence and David O.

She was one of the first literary writers to explore the transformation of Russia into the Soviet Union and the police state that was constructed there under Joseph Stalin. While her work does not approach the literary force of Alexander Solzhenitsyn or Varlam Shalamov and didn't reach major public attention, it represented an early sustained effort to expose legal and penal developments in the Soviet Union that, in the 1930s and 1940s, were little discussed outside Russian emigrant circles. When show trials and labour camps were referred to in newspapers and books at the time, the tone was generally sensational and made little attempt to connect them to Soviet political culture or to everyday life. Piccard, who was born in the late 1870s, made a teaching career in Russia, while marrying a Swiss who had come to Russia. She taught at a lyceum until fleeing with her family to Western Europe in 1925. From the twenties to the 1960s, she was active as a writer and translator (from Russian into French) and in 1929 began putting out her cycle of novels Épisodes de la Grande Tragédie Russe (\"Episodes from the Great Tragedy of Russia\") comprising:",

Born in Switzerland in 1884, Eulalie studied physics at the University of Zurich before marrying Auguste in 1907. Together they embarked on several groundbreaking scientific expeditions using balloons and aircraft.\n\nIn 1931, Eulalie accompanied Auguste on their historic flight over the North Pole in the balloon \"Southern Cross\", becoming the first woman to achieve this feat. During the expedition, she collected data on temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed at different altitudes, providing valuable information about the Earth's atmosphere that contributed to the development of meteorology as a scientific discipline. Her findings also helped to dispel myths about the polar regions being devoid of weather phenomena.\n\nAfter World War II, Eulalie resumed her work in atmospheric sciences, studying the effects of pollution on the environment. In recognition of her contributions to science, she received numerous awards including the Order of the Crown from Belgium and the Légion d'honneur from France.

The city lies at the confluence of two rivers, the Martapura River and the Sekongko River, which merge to form the Barito River. Banjarmasin is known for its rich cultural heritage and history, with influences from both Malay and Dayak cultures.\n\nThe name \"Banjarmasin\" comes from the words \"banja\", meaning river, and \"masiṇ\", meaning mix or blend, referring to the blending of the two rivers.[1] The city's location on the banks of these rivers made it an important trading hub throughout its history. In the early 19th century, Banjarmasin was ruled by a sultanate that controlled much of southern Borneo; however, after Dutch colonization in the late 1800s, the Sultanate was abolished and replaced with a Residency administered by the Dutch East Indies government. During World War II, Banjarmasin was occupied by Japanese forces before being reclaimed by Allied troops in 1945.\n\nToday, Banjarmasin is a bustling commercial center with a growing economy based on industries such as timber, oil palm plantations, and natural gas extraction. The city also has several universities and colleges, including Universitas Muhammadiyah Banjarmasin and STIE Perbanas Surabaya Banjarmasin. Banjarmasin is home to many places of interest, including the traditional floating market, Kampung Dalam (a historic neighborhood built on stilts above the water), and the Museum Negeri Propinsi Sulawesi Tenggara, which showcases the region's diverse culture and history. Visitors can also enjoy local cuisine like pangsit goreng (fried noodles) and various types of freshwater fish dishes.

Add the vanilla and whisk until smooth. Strain the custard through a fine-meshed sieve into a medium bowl. Place the bowl of custard into the ice water and stir occasionally until cool. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. To prepare the crust: Preheat the oven to 350F. Place the vanilla wafers and melted butter in a 9-inch pie pan and mix until all of the vanilla wafers are moistened. Firmly press the mixture to cover the bottom and sides of the pan and bake the pie crust for 20 minutes, or until it is lightly browned. Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. To prepare the pie: Peel the bananas and slice them into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Arrange half of the bananas in an even layer in the bottom of the crust. Spoon half of the cooled custard over the bananas and spread smooth. Place the remaining bananas in an even layer over the custard and top with the remaining custard. Refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours or overnight.\\ To prepare the topping: Whip the cream with an electric mixer on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the powdered sugar and whip on medium-high speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until soft peaks form. (Test for soft peaks by pulling the beaters straight up. The cream should pull up with the beaters and form a peak, and when it releases, the tip should fold over and be slightly soft.) Spoon the whipped cream over the custard and refrigerate the pie until you are ready to serve it. The process of whisking a little hot liquid into the eggs is called tempering the eggs. This is necessary whenever you are adding eggs to a hot liquid. Tempering allows the eggs to slowly increase in temperature without cooking them. If the eggs were added directly to the hot liquid they would cook and you would end up with scrambled eggs floating in the half-and-half. Ice water baths are used to quickly cool foods to a safe temperature. Perishable foods, in this case the eggs and milk, should be kept below 40F or above 140F. Ice water baths shorten the time in the danger zone (between 41F and 139F) where bacteria growth can occur.",

He was born at North Shields, Northumberland. Lee made his debut in county cricket for Northumberland in the 1929 Minor Counties Championship against Durham. Before the start of World War II in 1939, Lee made 67 appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship. In 1935, Lee made his first-class debut for a combined Minor Counties team against the Oxford University at the University Parks. Batting first, the Minor Counties made 251 all out. In their second-innings, the Minor Counties made 294 all out, with Lee making 45 runs before he was once again dismissed by Whitehouse. Oxford University reached 23 without loss in their second-innings, with the match declared a draw. The following season he made a second first-class appearance for the Minor Counties against Ireland at Observatory Road, Dublin. Batting first, Ireland were dismissed for 102, which the Minor Counties responded to by making just 69 in their first-innings, which saw Lee dismissed for 5 runs by James Graham. Ireland then made 179 in their second-innings, setting the Minor Counties a target of 213 for victory. Chasing that target, the Minor Counties were dismissed for just 133, with Lee being dismissed for a single run by the same bowler. Following World War II, he played a further Minor Counties Championship match for Northumberland against Staffordshire.",
        "direct_prompt": "Horace Lee was an American entrepreneur and inventor who is best known for his invention of the first practical electric toothbrush. Born in Ohio in 1908, Lee showed an early interest in science and technology, and after completing his education he went on to work as an engineer at various companies throughout his career.\n\nIn 1938, while working as an electrical engineer at Procter & Gamble, Lee became interested in developing a powered device that could help people clean their teeth more effectively than traditional brushing methods. After several years of research and development, he finally succeeded in creating the first practical electric toothbrush, which featured bristles mounted onto a rotating head driven by a small motor. The new product was introduced to consumers under the brand name Broxodent in 1939, and it quickly gained popularity due to its ability to remove plaque and debris from between teeth and hard-to-reach areas.\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s, Horace Lee continued to innovate and improve upon his original design, eventually leading to the creation of the first sonic toothbrush in 1957. This groundbreaking invention used high frequency vibrations instead of rotations to clean teeth, providing even further improvements in oral hygiene. In recognition of his contributions to dentistry and personal care, Lee received numerous awards and accolades over the course of his career, including being inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006. He passed away in 2008 at the age of 100, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and progress in the field of dental health.",

        "human_text": " The story is told by various members of the Garde: Number Four (John Smith), who is on the run with Sam, Six, and Bernie Kosar (aka Hadley, a Lorien Chimæra), and Number Seven (Marina), who's hiding at Santa Teresa, a convent in Spain. While John, Number Six and Sam try to stay ahead of the Mogadorians while searching for the other surviving Loric, Number Seven searches for news of John after his heroic battle at the school that came at the end of I Am Number Four. Marina is introduced in the story right from the start. She lives in a religious community for children in need. Along with her is Adelina and a few friends she has at the school in Santa Teresa, Spain. Marina greatly dislikes the school. After failing to adapt to life on Earth and blend in, Number Seven, Marina, and her Cêpan, Adelina, went to the Santa Teresa convent/orphanage and had been living there for 10 years. Adelina has given up hope of Lorien rising and has tried to adapt to life as a nun. She has hidden Seven's Chest and has all but ignored her. Annoyed by Adelina's attitude, Marina has been searching for the now legendary Number Four in order to unite the Garde, but so far, without any success. At the beginning of the book she is five months away from her eighteenth birthday, when she will be able to leave the orphanage. When a seven-year-old named Ella is brought in Marina instantly becomes good friends with her. Ella helps her find her Chest and Marina drugs Adelina to open it. When she does, they are tracked down by the Mogadorians and barely escape. Adelina finally acknowledges her wrongs and sacrifices herself to save Marina. Marina meets a man named Crayton who explains that Ella is Number Ten, and who is also an Aeternus, having the ability to change her age to that of an age she has already lived. They meet with Six and kill their pursuers. Héctor, a human who is friends with Marina and knows about Lorien, dies in the process. The group of Marina (Seven), Six, Ella, and Crayton resolve to find the other numbers so they can band together. John wakes up in the motel that he arrived in at the end of I Am Number Four with Six and Sam. They attempt to remain unnoticed (as Four is in the FBI Ten Most Wanted List) and replace their license plate with another driver's before driving through Tennessee. In Tennessee, they are pulled over by a policeman who asks them why they are driving with a license plate that belongs to another vehicle. The officer then realizes who they are, and calls in additional help. Six uses her legacy of controlling the elements to create gale force winds that allow them to escape. Four, Six, and Sam head to Florida, where they all begin training. Four speculates that Sam has a crush on Six. At first Sam denies it, but eventually admits that he does. Four knows he has a crush on Six too, but tries to push those feelings away because he wants to love Sarah. Six convinces Four to open his chest. While going through the items in the chest, Four shows Sam the Solar System item. Because Seven touches her transmitter (unaware of what it is), the Solar System morphs into Earth with Santa Teresa displayed by a red dot. Seven is heard screaming at Adelina. Four opens his letter from Henri in private, and learns that not only are the nine Garde members actually going to be the next nine elders, but that Sam may be correct about his father's alien abduction, and that his father was assigned to Four and Henri to teach them Earth's ways. Four shows Sam the letter and Sam begins to cry upon learning about his father's fate. Later that night, Four and Six are both suffering from sleep insomnia and decide to take a walk. Six uses her invisibility legacy to help them remain unseen. They almost share a kiss, but Four pulls away because he refuses to think he has feelings for anyone other than Sarah. When they return home, their house explodes after the Mogadorians learn their location because of Four opening his chest. Sam saves some items and hides in the pool, but a short battle with the Mogadorians ensues where the Mogadorians are defeated, but not before taking Four's chest. Sam, thinking that his father left something for them in Paradise, forces the group to return. They retrieve a stone tablet and some papers, but are unable to decipher their meaning. Four secretly meets up with Sarah. Upon their reunion, they hug and kiss. Sarah briefly checks her phone and John asks who she is texting so late at night. She tells him it's Emily, and they go back to their conversation. Sarah repeatedly tries to persuade Four to turn himself in, but he refuses each time. The FBI shows up and takes Four and Sam as prisoners. Six helps them escape, and Four realizes that Sarah was actually texting the police and not Emily. The group decides to split up after Four and Sam decide that they want to go retrieve Four's chest in West Virginia, Sam only because he hopes to find his father, while Six decides to go to Spain to rescue Seven. When Four and Sam drop Six off at the airport, she kisses Sam on the cheek to say goodbye which makes him blush. Four and Six share a passionate kiss on the lips to say goodbye. Four tells Six that Sam has a crush on her, to which she says that she has a crush on him too. Four, confused, tells her that she thought she liked him, to which she says that since Four loves her and Sarah, it's only fair that she can love Sam and Four. She gives them an address to which they are supposed to rendezvous in two weeks and she departs. Sam puts the address in his pocket, and they head off for West Virginia. Six arrives at Santa Teresa to assist in her battle with Seven, and helps her defeat the Mogadorians. She finds out that a second ship left after the one that carried the other Lorics to Earth, and carried another member of the Garde, Ella, or Number Ten. Six, Seven, Ten, and Crayton, Ten's substitute cêpan, head out to find other members of the Garde. Once at the end of the road in West Virginia, Sam and Four follow a map left by Six until they reach the Mogadorian cave. Four uses a Xlitharis to transfer Six's invisibility legacy to himself, although he will only have the legacy for one hour. Right when the legacy expires, they receive the chest along with another chest (that is later revealed to belong to Nine). Four uses fire to defeat many Mogadorians, and the main power goes out which allows Four and Sam to rescue Nine. Sam is determined to find his father, who he thinks is among the prisoners, and Four and Nine have no other choice but to leave him there after a force field separates them. Four realizes that the rendezvous point address is with Sam, but Nine tells him not to worry and that if the rendezvous is meant to occur, then it will. Four tells him to head north, and they begin driving.",

Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. Both are looking to Russia and China to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature.\nHeineken's net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; £371m) during 2004, from 798m euro a year ago. It blamed weak demand in western Europe and currency losses. It had warned in September that the weakening US dollar, which has cut the value of foreign sales, would knock 125m euros off its operating profits. Despite the dip in profits, Heineken's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in \"aggressive\" and \"high-impact\" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005. Heineken, which also owns the Amstel and Murphy's stout brands, said it would also seek to cut costs. This may involve closing down breweries.\nHeineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit.\nCarlsberg, the world's fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries. Nevertheless, total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia and Poland. Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. However, it also plans to cut 200 jobs in Sweden, where sales have been hit by demand for cheap, imported brands. \"We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, social and structural reasons,\" investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg.",
        "direct_prompt": "LONDON - The British brewing industry, once synonymous with prosperity and growth, is facing its toughest times in decades as declining sales and increased competition take a toll on profit margins.\n\nAccording to recent reports, major brewers such as Carlsberg UK and Heineken UK have seen a sharp decline in earnings for the first time in years. Industry experts attribute this downturn to changing consumer preferences towards healthier drinks and the rise of craft breweries offering unique flavours that cannot be replicated by larger companies.\n\nIn addition, rising raw material costs due to Brexit-related supply chain disruptions and increasing taxes on alcohol are further exacerbating the situation. As a result, many large breweries are scaling back production or diversifying into other areas like soft drinks to stay afloat.\n\nHowever, small independent microbreweries are capitalising on consumers’ growing interest in artisanal products, using traditional methods and innovative recipes to attract customers seeking new experiences. This shift in market dynamics has left big players struggling to adapt, leading some analysts to question whether the iconic British pub culture centred around beer will survive the ongoing transformation.",

His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented.

        "human_text": " After John (J.R.R. Tolkien), Jack (C.S. Lewis), and Charles (Charles Williams) return from their last adventure in the Archipelago, they spend five years in the Summer Country, our world. The Caretakers form a group at Oxford, including two close friends, Hugo Dyson and Owen Barfield. Hugo has become so close a friend that John and Jack consider making him an apprentice Caretaker of the Imaginarium Geographica and the Archipelago. Soon after they show Hugo the Geographica, he shows them a book sent to him from Charles, who is in France. The book has a mysterious foreword supposedly written by Hugo in his own blood. They decide to take a walk to take a break from all the confusion. Hugo enters a door in the wood and disappears somewhere in time. Hugo believes that he is being pranked by his companions, but eventually realizes this is not the case. John and Jack meet the Royal Animal Rescue Team, a group of badgers led by Uncas - the son of Tummeler - and his son Fred. They inform the men that fourteen years ago they were ordered to save John, Jack and Charles from an unknown event in the near future. Preparing to leave, Uncas unknowingly shuts the mysterious door, the remainder of the rescue team and the surrounding Oxford area to vanish. Noting the new desiccated land that lies before them called Albion, the group sets out to discover what has become of their world. After they escape from giants contained in a tower, the group is rescued from a Wicker Man by a man called Chaz. Resembling Charles, the two men and badgers realize that \"Chaz\" is not the Charles they know. Chaz is rough, scared and distrustful from his many years of surviving but the party is sure that Chaz is Charles, just from a different timeline in which Mordred, the Winter King, rules and the Archipelago is destroyed. Chaz leads the group to Bert, who gives John a skull of the deceased Jules Verne, a map, and the Serendipity Box which provides the opener with the thing he needs most. Mordred appears, courtesy of the traitorous Chaz and binds the men and badgers using their true names and departs. Uncas releases the men, who with the help of Bert, who uses a scarab brooch given to him by the Serendipity Box, creates an ocean and the Red Dragon that the companions leave on, except for Bert, who stays behind. On an island, the party discovers a time machine created by Jules Verne left for them in order to fix the problem that Hugo created, that led to the creation of Albion. The time machine runs like a projector, and the first slide is of Ancient Greece, where the companions meet two twins, Myrddyn and Madoc. They deduce that one is the Cartographer of Lost Places and the other is Mordred. In the next slide, the companions visit the Library of Alexandria and find Meridian(Myrddyn), the twin who becomes the Cartographer. They discover that the Holy Grail is being held in this library, and that Madoc, the twin who becomes Mordred, has been sleeping with her. Meridian binds Madoc and when they try to escape, Chaz unknowingly uses his fire balls and causes the fire that destroyed the Library of Alexandria. In the third slide, the companions meet Hugo. They witness the Tournament of Champions, held to determine the next ruler of Meridian's Precinct, modern-day Britain. The three main entrants in this tournament are Merlin, who is the Cartographer, Mordred and Thorn, a young boy who is destined to become the Arthur, or High King. During the fight between Merlin and Mordred, Hugo throws a dagger at Mordred to prevent him from becoming King. Hugo disqualifies both Merlin and Mordred, letting Thorn become Arthur. However, Arthur does not command the loyalty of the people as he would if the fight continued normally. In the fourth slide, the companions fight in a civil war against Arthur, as Merlin has united with the local rulers to gain the crown. Mordred has allied with Arthur. However, Arthur tries reason with Mordred, and so Mordred kills Arthur. The companions learn that Arthur can be resurrected by the Holy Grail. They journey to Avalon, where they encounter the priestess that slept with Mordred, and bring back her daughter. They are forced to leave Chaz, who becomes the first Guardian of Avalon, or the Green Knight. The companions leave Chaz the Lance of Longinus. The daughter of the priestess, named Rose, revives Arthur, who cuts off Mordred's hand when he attempts to kill Merlin. Mordred disappears. Arthur summons the dragons, uniting the fiefdoms and ending the civil war. Merlin departs to become the Cartographer. In the fifth slide, the companions meet Geoffrey of Monmouth, and journey to the Keep of Time, where they talk with the Cartographer. He gives them a key that lets them access the top room of the Keep of Time, the future. The party emerges from the door they first entered, and are summoned to talk with Richard Burton. He tells them that he caused Hugo to travel into the past with the backing of the Imperial Cartological Society. He intended to show the Caretakers that Mordred was merely a victim of fate. He did not know about the creation of Albion when Hugo violated the contest. He also could not see Rose, addressing Hugo, Bert, John, Jack and Charles as though they were the only ones present. In a pre-World War II setting, it is hinted that Mordred has rediscovered the Lance of Longinus, and is ready to begin another assault.",

        "human_text": "Deaths in custody have reached \"shocking\" levels, a committee of MPs and peers has warned.\nThe joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems. Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals. There was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, MPs said. The report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate \"amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group\".\nMany of those who ended up taking their own lives had \"presented themselves\" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said. It questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided.\nIncreased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said. Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: \"Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.\n\"Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives.\" \"These highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly ill-suited to meet even their basic needs. \"Crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. The misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered. \"Until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and meet our duty of care to them.\"\nThe committee also highlighted \"deeply worrying\" cases of children and young people taking their own lives. Between 1990 and 2004, 25 children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres. It picked out the case of Joseph Scholes, who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in Stoke Heath Young Offender Institution in March 2002, and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry. It revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies, the 16-year-old was depressed, exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about 30 times. Even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness, he was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order. Nine days into his sentence, Joseph hung himself from the bars of his cell window with a sheet.",
        "direct_prompt": "A report by a group of UK parliamentarians has revealed that deaths in police custody have doubled over the past five years, shocking lawmakers and prompting calls for urgent action to address the issue. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) released data showing that there were 44 fatal incidents involving people in police custody between March 2017 and March 2018, up from 21 during the same period four years earlier.\n\nThe all-party parliamentary group on race and community said the figures showed that black individuals were disproportionately affected by these tragedies, with more than half of those who died being from minority ethnic backgrounds. They also highlighted cases where basic procedures had not been followed or where officers failed to intervene when they should have done so.\n\nChairwoman of the committee, Labour MP Diane Abbott, described the findings as \"deeply disturbing\" and called for an overhaul of the system to prevent further avoidable deaths. She urged authorities to take immediate steps to improve training protocols and increase transparency around investigations into such incidents.\n\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and promised to work closely with law enforcement agencies to implement changes aimed at reducing the number of custodial deaths. He emphasized the need for better reporting mechanisms and increased accountability within the policing sector.\n\nHowever, some campaigners argued that mere procedural adjustments would not be sufficient to tackle the root causes of this problem. They demanded broader reforms addressing systemic racism and inequality within society, which they claimed contributed to disproportionate representation of certain groups among victims of police brutality.",

        "human_text": "I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?<br/><br/>And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney \"adventure\" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?<br/><br/>And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...<br/><br/>I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen \"Pirates\" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, \"Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?\"<br/><br/>And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?<br/><br/>I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?<br/><br/>I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.<br/><br/>Except for this year.<br/><br/>Go Jack.<br/><br/>And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected \"money shots\" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, \"You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!\" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.<br/><br/>And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking \"overproduced by\" credit on the cover-liner. \"Bombastic.\" \"Overdone.\" \"Absurdly Stupendous.\"<br/><br/>Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.<br/><br/>Once again, the children were wondering, \"What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?\"<br/><br/>Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, \"Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho\" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.<br/><br/>At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.<br/><br/>This is not just another \"entry\" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has become synonymous with swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, but none capture the magic and excitement quite like the original - 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'. Johnny Depp's unforgettable portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is nothing short of iconic, bringing humor, charm, and depth to what could have been just another stereotypical pirate character. \n\nFrom the breathtaking action sequences (that still hold up today) to the richly detailed world-building that immerses you in the fantastical realm of pirates and cursed treasures, this film excels at every turn. It also boasts a talented supporting cast including Geoffrey Rush as the cunning Barbossa and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, whose journey from reluctant hero to full-fledged buccaneer will leave you cheering for more.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for an adrenaline-pumping ride filled with nonstop entertainment, look no further than Disney's classic 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.' Its timeless appeal continues to captivate audiences young and old alike, making it one of the most beloved movies of all time.\"",

Jacob Hunt is eighteen years old and has Asperger's syndrome, which is a form of high-functioning autism. He lives with his mother and brother, Emma and Theo Hunt, and lives by a structured schedule, feeling comfortable only when all of his daily activities are planned. Any lack of structure or unexpected events cause him to feel anxious. He is obsessed with forensic analysis; the hobby consumes his life. The novel opens with Jacob setting up a crime scene (in which he is the victim) for his mother to solve. Jacob's need to engage in such activities, as well as his obsession with detail, often frustrates his mother and infuriates his brother Theo. When Jess Ogilvy, Jacob's social skills counselor, is killed, Jacob soon becomes a suspect. After arresting and releasing the first suspect, Mark Maguire, Detective Rich Matson asks Emma if he may talk to Jacob. After Jacob admits that he moved Jess's dead body, Jacob is arrested and charged with murder. The case goes to trial. In court, the prosecutor, Helen Sharp, raises the issues that all of Jacob's symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome are almost identical to the characteristics of those who are guilty. Also, the prosecution argues that most of the evidence proves that Jacob is the murderer (e.g. Jacob's fingerprints on the scene of the crime, an unlabeled crime scene evaluation identical to Jess's found in his notebook, and her backpack he retrieved from her home). At the end of the trial, Jacob testifies that he found Jess, dead in her bathroom and lying in a pool of her own blood. He admits to cleaning her, dressing her and placing her outside, then cleaning the original scene up and creating a new one that will lead investigators in a different direction. This is because he realized that, while an accident, Jess's death was the fault of his brother, Theo, after he was in the house and saw Jess naked. Jess slipped while getting out of the shower, and Theo fled the scene. In the end, Jess's death was in fact an accident.",

It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",

The performances are outstanding across the board, with Morgan Freeman delivering another stellar turn as abolitionist John Quincy Adams.

He is known for his excavation of the city of Gordium, capital of the ancient Phrygians and associated with the legendary king, Midas. Young received an A.B. in Classics from Princeton University in 1929, and then an M.A. from Columbia University in 1932, written under the direction of William Dinsmoor, Sr. In 1940 Young earned his Ph.D. in classics and archaeology from Princeton University.  He had excavated in the agora at Athens before becoming Curator of the Mediterranean Section of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and Professor of Classical Archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950, where he helped to build the graduate program known today as the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World. At the same juncture, Young began a series of new excavations at Gordium and continued as director until his untimely death in 1974. His major work on Phrygian tumuli - including the famed \"Midas Mound\" or Tumulus MM was published posthumously. After his death the leadership of the excavations eventually passed to his student, G. Kenneth Sams, now Professor of Classical Archaeology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

        "human_text": "Jonathan Edwards (October 5, 1703 – March 22, 1758) was an American revivalist preacher, philosopher and Congregationalist theologian. Edwards is widely regarded as one of America's most important and original philosophical theologians. Edwards' theological work is broad in scope, but rooted in the pedobaptist Puritan heritage as exemplified in the Westminster and Savoy Confessions of Faith. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first revivals in 1733–35 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts. His theological work gave rise to a distinct school of theology known as the New England theology. Edwards delivered the sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\", a classic of early American literature, during another revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of the Thirteen Colonies.  Edwards is well known for his many books, The End for Which God Created the World, The Life of David Brainerd, which inspired thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century, and Religious Affections, which many Calvinist Evangelicals still read today. Edwards died from a smallpox inoculation shortly after beginning the presidency at the College of New Jersey in Princeton. He was the grandfather of Aaron Burr, the third United States vice president.",

Giselle quickly ingratiates herself to the small clique of girls she and Ruby first meet when arriving at Greenwood, using them to amuse herself. Despite her problems with her sister, Ruby manages to make friends with the blind piano player Louis Turnbull, who is the school founder's only grandson; the art teacher, Miss Stevens; and a fellow student, Abby, who shares Ruby's intellectual ambitions. She even rekindles her relationship with Beau Andreas. As time goes on however, Giselle becomes jealous of Ruby's friendship with Abby. She exposes Abby as a quadroon at the school's Halloween dance, a secret Abby had been keeping in order to study at Greenwood. Abby leaves the dance in the middle of a violent storm, but returns the next morning to formally withdraw, as Mrs Ironwood will not permit her to stay with her ethnic background. Disgusted by Giselle's behavior, Ruby is poised to leave as well, but Abby urges her to stay and continue in her artistic endeavors. Miss Stevens comforts Ruby later, telling her that she will always have her help and guidance if she needs it. Days later, Ruby discovers to her horror that Pierre has died of a heart attack. After the funeral, Mrs Ironwood threatens to expel Ruby, saying she has eyewitness accounts of her having sexual liaisons with the school caretaker. Fortunately, Louis and Miss Stevens come to her aid, testifying that Ruby could not have been in those places at that time, as she was with Louis. Miss Stevens vouches for Ruby's character and Ruby is exonerated, though the mystery remains. During the Christmas vacation, Ruby walks in on Giselle standing up without the aid of a stick. She forces her sister to confess that she was the one who met the school caretaker, but Giselle dismisses what happened, since Ruby was not expelled. Although walking is still difficult, she says her legs are getting stronger. Ruby threatens to tell Daphne that Giselle is using her paralysis to make people run and fetch for her, but Giselle merely retorts that she will tell Daphne about Ruby resuming her relationship with Beau. After this less than merry Christmas, Ruby and Giselle return to Greenwood, where Ruby discovers that Miss Stevens has resigned over a scandal where she was accused of seducing a female student. Ruby knows this to be a lie, but is powerless to do anything to help Miss Stevens. Her troubles are further compounded when she learns that she has become pregnant with Beau's child after they had unprotected sex during a visit to the campus. Ruby leaves Greenwood and returns to New Orleans, where Daphne informs her that Beau's parents have sent him away to attend school in France after learning about the pregnancy. She then arranges for Ruby to have an illegal abortion. Ruby feels so depressed and alone that she does not object, but after seeing the dilapidated state of the clinic Daphne sends her to, she runs back to her home town of Houma. On her way there, she tries to get in touch with Beau, but discovers that he has already left for France. Despondent, Ruby contacts her half-brother, Paul Tate, instead. He is glad to hear from her, but warns her that Grandperè Jack is in a terrible state, having gone semi-mad after she left. They find him near the old shack she shared with Grandmere Catherine, but after a brief altercation with Paul, Jack runs off and drowns in the swamps. Later Paul offers her a home for her and her baby in a newly built mansion named Cypress Woods, but Ruby is very reluctant to accept the offer, as she knows people will assume that the child is Paul's if she accepts his help. She also suspects that he is still in love with her and does not want to encourage his feelings. At the climax, Ruby gives birth to her daughter, Pearl, in a hurricane which blows away many (if not most) of the surrounding homes. This is later described as one of the worst storms in decades. At the end of the story, Ruby is uplifted by the birth of her baby and believes her future is bright and hopeful.",

The site was the most popular place for people swapping and sharing links for the BitTorrent network. A recent study showed that more than half of the peer-to-peer traffic during June was for the BitTorrent system.\nIn a message posted on Suprnova.org on Sunday, the site's controllers said the site was \"closing down for good in the way that we all know it\". If the site did return, the message said, it would not be hosting any more torrent links. It continued: \"We are very sorry for this, but there was no other way, we have tried everything. \" The only parts that would keep going, said the operators of the Suprnova site, were the discussion forums and net chat channels. The site is thought to have closed following an announcement by the Motion Picture Association of America that it was launching legal action against those operating BitTorrent servers rather than end users. Because of the way that BitTorrent works, server sites do not host the actual file being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have it. By targeting servers, the MPAA hopes to cripple BitTorrent's ability to share files. In the opening days of the MPAA campaign, the organisation filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server site. The launching of the legal seems to be having an effect. Phoenix Torrents, another popular BitTorrent site, has also decided to shut down and, though it gave no reasons for the closure, it is thought to be motivated by the threat of legal action. Last week Finnish police raided a BitTorrent site based in the country that, according to reports, let 10,000 users shared pirated films, software, music and games.",
        "direct_prompt": "A new Hollywood-backed anti-piracy campaign has launched an attack on popular file-sharing sites, in what is being seen as a bid to reduce online piracy and boost legal streaming services.\nThe initiative called 'Alliance for Creativity' includes major studios such as Disney, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, Sony Picture Entertainment, Universal Studios along with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. The group aims to target illegal streams by taking down URLs associated with pirate content from search engines like Google.\n\nIn recent years, movie companies have suffered significant financial losses due to widespread copyright infringement facilitated through various internet platforms. This latest move comes after several high-profile lawsuits against notorious torrent site operators including the founder of KickassTorrents Artem Vaulin who was arrested last year.\n\nHowever, some experts argue that this approach may be ineffective since it does little to address the root causes of piracy which include limited availability or accessibility of legitimate alternatives especially in regions where streaming service subscriptions are expensive compared to local income levels.\n\nNonetheless, members involved in Alliance for Creativity maintain their commitment towards protecting intellectual property rights while promoting creativity and innovation within the entertainment industry. They hope these efforts will encourage more people worldwide to choose authorized channels when accessing movies, TV shows etcetera thereby supporting artists financially.\n\nOverall, whether this fresh offensive proves successful remains uncertain but one thing seems clear -the battle between those fighting piracy and those engaged in it continues unabated.",

We find from both experiments\nand calculations that the coupling of the dominant transport orbital to the\nmetal is stronger for Au-based junctions when compared with Ag-based junctions.\nWe attribute this difference to relativistic effects, which results in an\nenhanced density of d-states at the Fermi energy for Au compared with Ag. We\nfurther show that the alignment of the conducting orbital relative to the Fermi\nlevel does not follow the work function difference between two metals and is\ndifferent for conjugated and saturated systems. We thus demonstrate that the\ndetails of the molecular level alignment and electronic coupling in\nmetal-organic interfaces do not follow simple rules, but are rather the\nconsequence of subtle local interactions.\n",

By employing a non-equilibrium Green's function approach, we find that the DOS at both electrodes plays a crucial role in determining the current-voltage characteristics and conductance fluctuations. Specifically, we observe an enhancement or suppression of the overall current depending on whether the energy levels align favorably with the molecular orbital energies or not. Furthermore, our results reveal that increasing the electrode DOS can lead to significant enhancements in the peak height as well as broadening of the Coulomb blockade oscillations observed experimentally. These findings provide valuable insights into designing efficient molecular electronics devices by tailoring the electronic structure of the metal contacts.",

A battle has taken place in which the Portuguese were defeated and their leader, the Viceroy's son Balthazar, captured; but the Spanish officer Andrea has been killed by none other than the captured Balthazar. His ghost and the spirit of Revenge (present onstage throughout the entirety of the play) serve as chorus and, at the beginning of each act, Andrea bemoans the series of injustices that take place before being reassured by Revenge that those deserving will get their comeuppance. There is a subplot concerning the enmity of two Portuguese noblemen, one of whom attempts to convince the Viceroy that his rival has murdered the missing Balthazar. The King's nephew Lorenzo and Andrea's best friend Horatio dispute over who captured Balthazar, and though it is made clear early on that it is in fact Horatio that defeated him while Lorenzo essentially cheats his way into taking partial credit, the King leaves Balthazar in Lorenzo's charge and splits the spoils of the victory between the two. Horatio comforts Lorenzo's sister, Bel-imperia, who was in love with Andrea against her family's wishes; despite her former feelings for Andrea, Bel-imperia soon falls for Horatio. Her courtship with Horatio is motivated partially by her desire for revenge. Bel-imperia intends to torment an amorous Balthazar, the killer of her former lover. As Balthazar is in love with Bel-imperia, the royal family concludes that their marriage would be an excellent way to repair the peace with Portugal. Horatio's father, the Marshall Hieronimo, stages an entertainment for the Portuguese ambassador; Lorenzo, suspecting that Bel-Imperia has found a new lover, bribes her servant Pedringano and discovers that Horatio is the man. He persuades Balthazar to help him murder Horatio during an assignation with Bel-Imperia; Hieronimo and his wife Isabella find the body of their son hanged and stabbed, and Isabella is driven mad. Revisions made to the original play supplement the scene with Hieronimo briefly losing his wits as well. Lorenzo locks Bel-Imperia away, but she succeeds in sending Hieronimo a letter, written in her own blood, informing him that Lorenzo and Balthazar were Horatio's murderers. His questions and attempts to see Bel-Imperia convince Lorenzo that he knows something; afraid that Balthazar's servant Serberine has betrayed the plot, Lorenzo convinces Pedringano to murder him, then arranges for Pedringano's arrest in the hopes of silencing him too. Hieronimo, appointed judge, sentences Pedringano to death; Pedringano expects Lorenzo to procure his pardon, and Lorenzo, having written a fake letter of pardon, lets him believe this right up until the hangman drops Pedringano to his death. Lorenzo manages to prevent Hieronimo from seeking justice by convincing the King that Horatio is alive and well. Furthermore, Lorenzo does not allow Hieronimo to see the King, claiming that he is too busy. This, combined with his wife's suicide, which happens just prior to Hieronimo's appeal to the King, pushes Hieronimo past his limit. He rants incoherently and digs at the ground with his dagger. Lorenzo goes on to tell his uncle, the King, that Hieronimo's odd behaviour is due to his inability to deal with his son Horatio's new found wealth (Balthazar's ransom from the Portuguese Viceroy), and he has gone mad with jealousy. Regaining his senses, Hieronimo, along with Bel-Imperia, feigns reconciliation with the murderers. The two plan to put on a play together, Soliman and Perseda. Under cover of the play they stab Lorenzo and Balthazar to death in front of the King, Viceroy, and Duke of Castile (Lorenzo and Bel-Imperia's father); Bel-Imperia kills herself, and Hieronimo tells his audience of his motive behind the murders, but refuses to reveal Bel-Imperia's complicity in the plot. He then bites out his own tongue to prevent himself from talking under torture, after which he kills the Duke and then himself. Andrea and Revenge are satisfied, delivering suitable eternal punishments to the guilty parties.",

However, as the scheme unfolds, Hieronimo's own dark past comes back to haunt him, leading to tragic consequences for all involved.

Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China. The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. The agreements with Iran were sealed after talks in New Delhi between Middle East producers and Asia's biggest energy consumers - China, India, Japan and South Korea.\nIran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields. Under the agreement, it will supply India with 7.5 million tonnes of LPG annually over a 25 year period from 2009. ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption.

The South Asian nation imports about 80% of its oil needs.\n\"This MoU will help us diversify our hydrocarbon supplies,\" said Dharmendra Pradhan, Indian Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas. \"It also aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Neighborhood First' policy.\"\nUnder the pact, state-owned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) would sell 1.5 billion cubic meters annually at $150-$180 less than the prevailing price on the international market according to an official statement issued after the signing ceremony.\nIn addition to importing gas, both sides agreed to explore possibilities of joint exploration and development of hydrocarbons resources across their maritime boundary which remains unresolved despite decades of negotiations.\nThe move comes amidst increasing strategic cooperation between India and Iran particularly in countering terrorism and balancing China's growing influence in the region. However, Washington has expressed concerns over expanding ties between New Delhi and Teheran fearing it could undermine efforts to isolate the Islamic Republic over its disputed nuclear program.",

By rotating in eight or four angles, the\nconvolutional layers could produce the corresponding number of feature maps\nbased on eight or four different kernels. By using flip, the convolution layer\ncan produce three feature maps. By combining produced feature maps using\nmaxout, the resource requirement could be significantly reduced while still\nretain the invariance properties.

We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original.

So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered.

It was used by the Chinese communists against the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II, and by the Chinese Soviet Republic in the Chinese Civil War.

After the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, Deng Xiaoping abandoned people's war for \"People's War under Modern Conditions\", which moved away from reliance on troops over technology. With the adoption of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\", economic reforms fueled military and technological investment. Troop numbers were also reduced and professionalisation encouraged.",

These conflicts often arise when one group seeks to overthrow another government through force, with the aim of establishing its own regime. \n\nDuring these wars people from all walks of life take on different roles like fighters (guerilleros), spies(Intelligence agents), medics etc. They operate behind enemy lines for extended periods without support form regular army units.

The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a \"nuclear dumpsite\".\nUnder current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a \"sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries\". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.\nTrade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to £680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: \"I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fears have been confirmed. \"Once again Britain's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI. \"This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the £48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. \"The Energy Act was supposed to help Britain clean up, but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. \"The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck.\"",
        "direct_prompt": "Environmental campaigners have criticised plans to create a nuclear waste disposal site in Cumbria, England. The proposed location is near the Lake District National Park and activists say it poses a threat to local wildlife and ecosystems. \n\nAccording to reports, the government has shortlisted two sites in Cumbria for the dumping of low-level radioactive waste from civil sources such as hospitals and universities. However, locals and environmentalists are opposing the move, arguing that the area's unique geology makes it unsuitable for such a project.\n\nCampaigner against Nuclear Energy (CANE) said: \"It defies logic to even consider burying toxic materials deep beneath our feet when we know full well what damage they can do.\" They added that there were already enough hazardous substances stored underground without creating more potential risks.\n\nThe Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy declined to comment on the matter but stated that the selection process was rigorous and transparent. It also emphasized that safety remained its top priority throughout the decision-making process.\n\nHowever, opponents argue that the public consultation process lacks transparency and fails to address crucial concerns about long-term consequences. They fear that once the waste is buried, it will be impossible to reverse any mistakes or unforeseen effects on the environment.\n\nLocal MP John Woodcock expressed his concern over the issue saying; \"I share many people's worries... We need proper scientific evidence before making decisions like this,\" he told ITV News.\n\nOpponents of the proposal plan to stage protests and demonstrations if the government goes ahead with its decision to build the facility in Cumbria.",

        "human_text": "The remarkably low rating that this film has so far received (4.1 as of Thursday 8th of June) is indicative of its ability to raise the hackles of people who haven't even seen it. How can it be otherwise when the film has not yet been released? 135 people have voted; have all of these 135 people actually watched the film? Of course not. They're just voting on the basis of their perceptions or assumptions concerning its political agenda. IMDb voters are not alone in this; already Simon Heffer in The Daily Telegraph, Dominic Lawson in The Independent, Ruth Dudley-Edwards in The Daily Mail and Michael Gove in The Times are attacking a film they haven't seen (by their own admission). These attacks are the predictable reaction of empire apologists unable to abide the depiction of the dark and brutal underside of that imperial machine, or the suggestion that anyone on the receiving end of that brutality might be justified in rebelling against it. The title of Dudley-Edward's lazy hack-job says it all, really: 'Why does Ken Loach loathe his country?' Loach is a traitor, and must be punished, the rotter.<br/><br/>It's a pity that this political controversy seems poised to overwhelm discussion of the film, because it's an extremely able piece of cinema and deserves to be seen as such. Barry Ackroyd's cinematography is superb, ably capturing the beauty of the Irish countryside without indulging in it. We are rooted in a locale without being lavished with pretty pictures. The acting is also excellent. The charismatic Cillian Murphy carries the movie, but the support from Liam Cunningham, Orla Fitzgerald, Aidan O'Hare and Padraic Delaney is also commendable.<br/><br/>But it's the collaboration between Loach and his scriptwriter Paul Laverty that makes the film something like a masterpiece. The grim progress from the murder of an Irish youth to the growth of an armed I.R.A. campaign, with its attendant violence (shown in stark and horrifying detail) is expertly managed; the only let-up comes not far from the end, after the signing of the 1921 peace treaty. Loach tries to show the brief jubilation and relief that ensues, but in terms of momentum almost drops the ball. The pace is re-established in time for the inexorable tragic denouement, and the film's final emotional impact is considerable. The load is occasionally lightened by the odd touch of Loach's characteristic wry comedy, such as the belligerence of the opening hurling game, the teenage message-boy who loses his message, the melodramatic pianist accompanying the newsreel announcing the momentous news of the creation of the Free State.<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing scenes occurs when a group of I.R.A. men return from a successful battle and discover a farmhouse being attacked and destroyed by a group of British soldiers. The rebels, who have no ammunition left, are forced to look on, concealed in the bushes; they watch powerless as the farmhouse's inhabitants are abused. We watch along with the characters, just as helpless as they are. Why do we watch? Do we want to intervene, to play the hero and save the day? Do we perhaps enjoy it? The trouble with many so-called anti-war films, as Loach has said, is that they outwardly condemn the violence while at the same time encouraging (intentionally or not) a vicarious pleasure in the thrill of it all. We want to take part, we imagine how we would behave in such circumstances (of course, we usually imagine ourselves behaving with impeccable bravery and surviving to fight another day). This scene, rather than placing us in the thick of the action, forces us to occupy the position of impotent bystander. Perhaps this is what being a film-goer is all about: powerless voyeurism. As we watch the country tear itself apart in civil war, manipulated by a devious and callous colonial master, this point becomes all the more pertinent. A quietly devastating film.",

But when Detective Inspector Bryant and Sergeant Luck of the Bath Police call upon Cranmer at his Somerset manor house and vineyard late on a Sunday evening, Cranmer finds himself facing repercussions from his secret and not-too-distant past. Pettifer, the reader eventually learns, was a British Secret Intelligence Service operative during the Cold War and Cranmer was his handler for some twenty years. The Cold War is over, the Berlin Wall has come down and SIS has put Cranmer and his agent Pettifer out to pasture. Pettifer turns to teaching at Bath University and Cranmer is content to settle at Honeybrook, his inherited estate in Somerset, growing wine and making love to his beautiful young mistress Emma. Not content with staying cloistered in Bath, Larry begins paying visits to Honeybrook and soon becomes a permanent fixture in their lives. At least, that is, until both Larry and Emma disappear. Panicked by his encounter with the Bath Police, Cranmer contacts his former employers and is summoned to London where he learns that, not only has Larry disappeared, he's absconded with some ₤37 million milked from the Russian Government with the help of a former Soviet spy. Cranmer finds himself suspected as Larry's accomplice by the Bath Police—and, later, by \"The Office,\" or SIS—and decides to track down his protégé and his former mistress. But why would a quixotic intellectual like Larry, a man who had no interest in money, suddenly wish to steal ₤37 million from the Russians? To solve this mystery, Cranmer begins calling on old contacts from Oxford to the arms trade to find out what his former agent and his purloined mistress have been up to in their disappearance. He also visits his secret archive of Office files, stashed away in the abandoned church of St. James the Less, bequeathed to him by the same Uncle Bob who left him Honeybrook. As he peruses his cache of documents, he begins to uncover the plot between Larry and Konstantin Checheyev, the former Soviet handler of Larry (the latter one pretended to work for Soviets during the Cold War). Checheyev, it seems, is not Russian but Ingush, a native of the high Caucasus and begrudged of the Russians who have displaced him and his people from their rightful homes. The Ingush are primed for an uprising against their Russian oppressors and Larry's the man to arm them.

Prime minister's questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. He attacked Tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but Mr Howard said Labour had proposed the idea too.\nThe Commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. The Tories have promised £4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. Mr Howard pointed to the Institute for Fiscal Studies' predictions that Labour will need to increase taxes to cover an £11bn gap in its spending plans. He accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard. Pointing to national insurance, he added: \"Everyone knows tax will go up under Labour: isn't it now clear which tax it would be?\"\nMr Blair instead hailed Labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. \"When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,\" he said. On the tax questions, he added: \"We will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto.\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the UK from outside the European Union.\nMr Blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. That would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. The prime minister ridiculed the Tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. He challenged the Tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a \"fantasy island\". Mr Howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU. But Mr Blair said: \"All the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the UN.\"",

However, opposition parties have criticised the plan, with some arguing that it will hit small businesses and self-employed individuals who are already struggling due to the pandemic.\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, described the proposal as a \"tax on jobs\" and called for more details on how the money raised would be spent. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey tweeted: \"Austerity hasn't worked - raising taxes won't fix our public services either.\"\n\nHowever, the Conservatives argue that the measure is necessary to tackle the growing deficit caused by the coronavirus pandemic. If implemented, the hike in NI contributions could generate an additional £12 billion annually, according to estimates.",

Well just to be sure, if the comporession is happening just for me, I asked my friend to watch that clip on his pc with his internet. Same stuff happening, we even watched a different streamers to see if it keeps happening. It did. So my question is, is it possible for me as a twitch user to download someones clip/whole stream, without the compression, like is there some role that the streamer must give me in order to download it in FHD without the copmression or is it really impossible, not even with any sites?",

        "human_text": "It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's \"worst\" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. <br/><br/>Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the \"comic book\" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me. <br/><br/>As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word \"powerful\". Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. <br/><br/>The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. ('…I see dead people…' '...They call me Mr. Glass…' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"I never thought M Night Shyamalan could surprise me again after his recent string of disappointments, but Unbreakable is a true masterpiece that proves he's still got the magic touch. The performances are top-notch, with Bruce Willis delivering one of his best roles in years as David Dunn, and Samuel L Jackson stealing every scene he's in as Elijah Price. The story is engaging from start to finish, weaving together themes of superhero mythology and real-world struggles in a way that feels fresh and original. And the twist ending? Wow, just wow. It will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew about the film and make you excited to see what Shyamalan does next.\"",

        "human_text": " Royal Earle Thompson owns a dairy farm in southern Texas during the late 1890s. His farm is fairly unproductive, due in part to Thompson's laziness and distaste for most of the required labor on a dairy farm, which he considers \"women's work.\" Thompson lives with his wife, Ellie, and his two small sons, Arthur and Herbert. Ellie is continually ill, though she does her best to perform her domestic duties around the house. The two boys, aged about six and eight when the story opens, are generally well-behaved. One day, a man named Olaf Helton presents himself at the farm. The remarkably taciturn Swede asks Farmer Thompson for a job. Thompson agrees to employ Helton, offering him a small monthly wage, plus room and board. It is clear that Thompson views Helton as somewhat beneath him because he is a foreigner. Even though the wage is far below what Helton reports having earned in the wheat fields of North Dakota, he nonetheless sets to work immediately and proves himself to be an efficient farmhand, single-handedly transforming Thompson's run-down dairy farm into a productive, profitable enterprise. Though he is unable to figure out anything about his Helton's personal life or origins, Thompson grows to appreciate and respect his mysterious, silent farmhand. He increases his pay and entrusts him with much responsibility. Ellie also values Helton for the prosperity he brings to the farm, and is troubled by him just once, in a bizarre event in which she sees Helton silently shake her two boys in a terrifying manner after they had snatched his harmonica. She tells Thompson about what she saw and asks him to tell Helton that in the future he is to leave the discipline of the boys to their parents, and the family quickly moves past the event. Nine years go by, and the Thompson dairy farm thrives, thanks to Helton's incomparable work ethic. The Thompsons come to view Helton as one of the family; his traits of rarely speaking, never smiling, and continually playing the same song on his precious harmonica, are oddities, once puzzling, that they simply accept. One day, an offensive and irritating stranger named Homer T. Hatch shows up at the farm. Like Helton, he has come to Texas from North Dakota, and, more interesting still, he is there to \"locate\" Helton. The man annoys Farmer Thompson immediately with his grating banter and subtle insults. Hatch eventually reveals the reason for his visit: he is a bounty hunter, and Olaf Helton is an escaped mental patient who must be returned to the asylum. Many years earlier, Helton killed his only brother with a pitchfork. The man had lost one of Helton's harmonicas and refused to replace it. Thompson is stunned by this news and unwilling to give up Helton to Hatch, whom he instinctively feels is an evil man. At this point, Helton, apparently believing Hatch is attacking Thompson, runs onto the scene, and Thompson sees Hatch drive a knife blade into Helton's stomach. Thompson rushes to Helton's defense, striking Hatch with an axe blade and killing him. Ellie comes on the scene only in time to see Hatch lying on the ground and Helton running away (unaccountably, in view of what Thompson \"saw\"), and she faints. The fleeing Helton, soon afterwards, in the midst of an apparent \"mad\" episode, such as he had never exhibited while with the Thompsons, is killed by the sheriff's men. When found, Helton's body bears no mark of a knife. It appears (though what happened is never explained) that Hatch's attack on Helton was Thompson's hallucination. Thompson impresses on Ellie the importance of her swearing that she witnessed Hatch attacking Helton, and she reluctantly agrees. After a perfunctory trial, Thompson is acquitted on the ground of self-defense/defense of another. Despite the verdict, Thompson continues to relive the killing, at one moment sure that there must have been a way to get Hatch off his farm without harming him, at the next certain that he had no choice and that if the scene were playing before his eyes again, he would instinctively act as he did before. Worse, he is sure that though he is legally \"not guilty,\" the community regards him as not innocent, and he fears that he has become an outcast. He decides to pay a visit on every household of the small farming community, accompanied by the unwilling Ellie, in an attempt to regain his reputation. His efforts are unsuccessful; both he and Ellie can see that they have lost the esteem of their neighbors and former friends. In a climactic scene at home, Thompson realizes that even his wife is afraid of him, and that their now nearly-grown sons no longer trust him with her. He decides that he must end his ruined life. Dressed in his best, he leaves the house and walks as far as he can while still on his land. He writes a note of explanation, saying that he never intended to harm Hatch, even though Hatch deserved to die; still, he is sorry that he had to be the one to kill him. Poignantly, Thompson puts no blame on Helton and observes that had Hatch come hunting him instead of Helton, his friend would have done the same for him. Thompson then shoots himself with his shotgun.",

        "human_text": "Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.\nThe law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force. Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. He said police would challenge the \"one of two isolated hunts\" which are threatening to break the law.\nBut Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. \"The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. \"You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,\" he said.\nThe Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. He has rejected a \"blanket policy\" of not enforcing the ban until the House of Lords has considered its legality. John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. He said police had \"acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences\".\nThe Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. Under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.\nAs well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to \"flush out\" foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. \"We are not going away. We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again,\" hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said. But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that \"people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about\". He said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting. \"Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting,\" he said.",
        "direct_prompt": "The ban on hunting with dogs has come into effect in England and Wales, following a controversial vote in parliament last year. The Hunting Act, which was passed in 2005 but did not come into force until today, makes it illegal to hunt wild mammals with dogs except for scientific or educational purposes.\n\nOpponents of foxhunting have welcomed the move, saying that it brings an end to a practice they describe as cruel and unnecessary. However, some hunters argue that the sport is a traditional part of British culture and should be allowed to continue.\n\nThere are fears among rural communities that the ban could lead to increased poaching and damage to farmland, although supporters of the measure say these concerns are unfounded. Police forces across England and Wales have received extra training ahead of the ban coming into force, in order to ensure that officers understand the new laws and know how to enforce them.\n\nThe RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) said it would be monitoring the situation closely and urged anyone who suspects animal welfare offences are taking place to report them to the police.",

He day-dreams constantly, has trouble engaging in lasting relationships and finds more meaning and immediacy in movies and books than in his own routine life. The loose plot of the novel follows Binx as he embarks on an undefined \"search,\" wandering around New Orleans, Chicago and the Gulf Coast reflecting philosophically on small episodes and interactions. He is constantly challenged to define himself in relation to friends, family, sweet-hearts and career despite his urge to remain vague and open to possibility. \"What is the nature of the search? you ask. Really it is very simple; at least for a fellow like me. So simple that it is easily overlooked. The search is what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the everydayness of his own life.\" The novel is heavily influenced by the existentialist themes of authors like Søren Kierkegaard, whom Percy read extensively. Unlike many dark didactic existentialist novels (including Percy's later work), The Moviegoer has a light poetic tone. It was Percy's first, most famous, and most widely praised novel.",

Despite feeling trapped by his circumstances, Binx resists change and refuses to conform to societal expectations. Eventually, he experiences a spiritual awakening after witnessing a Mardi Gras parade, which prompts him to reevaluate his priorities and seek out deeper connections with others.

I don't know what you guys expected but the movie CLEARLY suggests that Denzel is a crooked, burnt-out, streetwise cop and Ethan is a 'wet-behind-the-ears' clueless rookie. So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie. We KNOW that he can play those roles well so it's a testament to his acting ability that he can portray the other side of the spectrum. And my hat goes off to Ethan because he bounces off Denzel flawlessly.<br/><br/>I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.<br/><br/>Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.<br/><br/>Next time you guys bash a movie, make sure to try to be objective and rate what you see and not what you're used to seeing!!",

        "human_text": "Armstrong Field was a baseball park located in Dallas, Texas on the campus of Southern Methodist University located where Westcott Field now stands. It first hosted SMU football from 1915 through 1925 (Ownby Stadium opened in 1926). It was the home of the SMU baseball team (1919–1980) for many years though at least the final four seasons were played off campus. The Mustangs, Southwest Conference participants, were a team of futility during their time at Armstrong Field, scarcely in competition to win the conference. Armstrong Field did have the advantage of being located next to an outdoor school swimming pool. Legend has it that collegians would sit in the two rows at the top of the stands to see the women at the pool instead of watching the ballgame. Some were hit with foul balls due to their concentration on the women at the pool. The pool helped augment attendance by 40%. Armstrong Field was closed after the 1976 season, but before the last game the players stole home plate and concealed it in the storage area of Ownby Stadium. The plate was signed by the players and ended up in the SMU sports information division. The final four years (1977–1980) of SMU Mustangs baseball were played at Reverchon Park before the baseball program was phased out.

        "human_text": "  The dissolution process of small (initial (equivalent) radius $R_0 < 1$ mm)\nlong-chain alcohol (of various types) sessile droplets in water is studied,\ndisentangling diffusive and convective contributions. The latter can arise for\nhigh solubilities of the alcohol, as the density of the alcohol-water mixture\nis then considerably less as that of pure water, giving rise to buoyancy driven\nconvection. The convective flow around the droplets is measured, using\nmicro-particle image velocimetry ($\\mu$PIV) and the schlieren technique. When\nnondimensionalizing the system, we find a universal $Sh\\sim Ra^{1/4}$ scaling\nrelation for all alcohols (of different solubilities) and all droplets in the\nconvective regime. Here Sh is the Sherwood number (dimensionless mass flux) and\nRa the Rayleigh number (dimensionless density difference between clean and\nalcohol-saturated water). This scaling implies the scaling relation $\\tau_c\n\\sim R^{5/4}$ of the convective dissolution time $\\tau_c$, which is found to\nagree with experimental data. We show that in the convective regime the plume\nReynolds number (the dimensionless velocity) of the detaching alcohol-saturated\nplume follows $Re_p \\sim Sc^{-1} Ra^{5/8}$, which is confirmed by the $\\mu$PIV\ndata. Here, Sc is the Schmidt number. The convective regime exists when $Ra >\nRa_t$, where $Ra_t = 12$ is the transition Ra-number as extracted from the\ndata. For $Ra < Ra_t$ and smaller, convective transport is progressively\novertaken by diffusion and the above scaling relations break down.\n",
        "direct_prompt": "This study investigates the role of natural convection in the dissolution of sessile droplets. The experimental setup consists of a heated plate with a droplet placed on it, and the temperature gradient causes air to flow around the droplet. The results show that the rate of dissolution increases as the Rayleigh number is increased due to enhanced convective heat transfer. Additionally, the presence of Marangoni flows at the interface between the liquid and vapor phases can alter the dissolution kinetics by inducing mass transport within the droplet. Overall, this work provides insights into the complex interplay between thermal and mass transport processes during the dissolution of drops under natural convection conditions.",

        "human_text": "TV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.\nIt is called high-definition - HD for short - and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US. It is set, according to analysts, to do for images what CDs did for sound. Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive. But Europe's gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV.\nTo view it, it needs to be transmitted in HD format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. The next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. And most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. \"In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,\" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. \"Every game is going to be playable in HD. \"So consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. \"It's going to change really the way they look at gaming.\"\nAt the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony's European president, made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008. A previous prediction from analysts Datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of its content in HD by 2010.\nUntil broadcast rights, format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed, TV content will be limited. All TV images are made up of pixels which go across the screen, and scan lines which go down the screen. Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. HD offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV. \"Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,\" explains Dr Tuffy. But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. They are used to spending money on hardware to match a game's requirements. Demographics have changed too and the \"sweet spot\" for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. This means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technologies and HD projectors, earlier than others.\nHigher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.\nFor console developers though, HD offers some production changes. It could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks Dr Tuffy. \"But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,\" he says. \"You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. \"And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless.\" With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. At that point, says Dr Tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.",
        "direct_prompt": "Researchers have suggested that gamers may be instrumental in driving the development and adoption of next generation video technology, such as high definition (HD) displays. A study conducted by industry experts has found that gaming enthusiasts are more likely to invest in HD televisions or monitors than other groups, indicating that demand for higher quality visuals is on the rise.\n\nThe research indicates that advancements in game design and graphics processing capabilities have driven innovation in display technologies over recent years. As games become increasingly complex and visually stunning, players expect an immersive experience which can only be achieved with top-of-the-line equipment. This trend towards ever increasing graphical fidelity means that manufacturers must continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of resolution and image clarity.\n\nHowever, while there is certainly appetite among consumers for improved visualization experiences, affordability remains a key factor when it comes to widespread uptake of new tech. The cost of purchasing cutting edge hardware continues to deter many potential buyers from making investments in this area. Nevertheless, researchers believe that advances in manufacturing processes combined with increased competition within the market will eventually lead to lower prices across the board, enabling greater numbers of people access these superior viewing options.\n\nIn conclusion, although challenges remain regarding accessibility and pricing issues surrounding advanced screen solutions, evidence suggests that avid videogame fans play a crucial role pushing technological innovations forward. Their insatiable desire realistic immersion through vivid imagery drives forces shaping future media landscapes sure to benefit all entertainment industries alike.",

Now it doesn't really bother me if they have a handful of clothes that's fine, but if they just toss a whole pile of clothes and don't sort them or anything, it just gets on my nerves. Do they not realize how long it's gonna take to remove like 30 fucking hangers, and that it's literally holding up EVERYONE ELSE in line???? What makes it worse is that people usually put their clothes up last, so as I'm scanning everything else, they have time to at least take SOME hangers off instead of just dropping a big pile on me. Shout-outs to the customers who actually remove the hangers beforehand or before I start scanning them, it genuinely saves me so much time",

Mouffe sees Radical Democracy as a means for continuing to sustain the balance between the values of liberalism and democracy. This balance is accomplished through the agonistic practice of valuing and sustaining dissent in the democratic process as a more important goal than consensus. This point is where Radical Democratic theory diverges from both Habermas and Rawls, as it contradicts Habermas's quest for rational consensus and Rawls's project for political liberalism. Mouffe describes the importance of the radical democratic alternative in a 2009 interview, saying that \"The aim of a pluralist democracy is to provide the institutions that will allow them to take an agonistic form, in which opponents will treat each other not as enemies to be destroyed, but as adversaries who will fight for the victory of their position while recognising the right of their opponents to fight for theirs. An agonistic democracy requires the availability of a choice between real alternatives.\"",

Victory would have given Spain the title but they were outclassed. In Sunday's reverse singles, Carlos Moya takes on Andy Roddick before Rafael Nadal faces Mardy Fish. \"It feels good, but it's not going to be as good if we don't win two tomorrow,\" said Mike Bryan. \"It feels good to give those guys another shot, and Spain has to go to sleep on that.\" Bob Bryan added: \"I'm really confident in Andy winning that first match, and then anything can happen.\" Spain coach Jordi Arrese chose to rest 18-year-old Nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over Roddick on Friday. He was replaced by former world number one Ferrero, but the Spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world's best doubles teams.\nThe 26-year-old Bryan twins have won all four of their Davis Cup matches this year. And they quickly silenced the huge crowd at the Olympic Stadium, racing through the opening set to love. The Spaniards then twice surrendered breaks of serve at the start of the second before the Bryans broke to go 5-3 ahead and served out.

Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",

The supporting cast including Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross are equally impressive in their respective roles. Director Mike Nichols masterfully weaves together themes such as conformity vs rebellion, love triangles gone awry, all set against the backdrop of 1960s California suburbia that adds to the film's nostalgic charm.

Tory co-chairman Liam Fox had opened the forum in Brighton with an attack on Labour's record and party leader Michael Howard is due to speak later. Tony Blair has said Conservative policies would cause economic failure. But Mr Letwin said Britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league.\n\"Can this country compete, can this country prosper, unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy?\" he said. \"If we are going to take on the great challenges, the challenges like those posed by the Chinese and the Indians, we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax,\" he said. \"The fact is the very carefully costed, fully funded plans we have laid out for saving £12bn by 2007-2008 are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long-term basis.\" Mr Letwin said voting for Labour meant choosing higher taxes, borrowing and waste.\nEarlier, Dr Fox had said Labour's rule had been characterised by \"lost trust and failure to deliver\". He also attacked the government's \"failure\" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS, telling delegates Labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. A Tory government would sort out the \"shambles\" of immigration, put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools, he said. Michael Howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech. His welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in London to lead the party's opposition to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill in its lengthy progress through Parliament. The bill was finally passed on Friday evening, after more than 30 hours of debate. Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year.",

Critics have argued that now is not the time to cut taxes, with public services already under strain due to the pandemic. However, the Conservatives maintain that targeted reductions in taxation would incentivize business investment and create jobs.",

Comedy, Jim Carrey, I thought this had to be it. I was wrong, and boy, am I glad I goofed.<br/><br/>Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, a fairly ordinary-seeming man, an animal control officer whose wife Aggie (played by Virginia Madsen) happens to buy him what seems to be the only copy of a self-published novel, THE NUMBER 23. But as Walter reads the book, the story of a homicide detective named Fingerling, he finds the character reminding him of himself. As he reads of the character Fingerling's descent into obsession and madness, he becomes increasingly disturbed himself, and goes hunting for the pseudononymous author, determined to find out what it all means. The answer uncovers a dark secret involving a murder committed over a decade ago, and alters the lives of Walter and his family permanently.<br/><br/>I won't say more, it would give away too much, but I found this wonderfully acted, beautifully written, and altogether involving. Carrey excellently plays both Walter Sparrow and Dec. Fingerling (in scenes from the novel shown as Carrey reads it), Madsen shines as loving housewife Aggie and novel character Fabrizia, and the supporting players turn in excellent performances, particularly Lynn Collins as the novel character Suicide Blond. The photography is frequently dark and threatening, which fits the plot, the sets are marvelous, and the climax is perfect.<br/><br/>I hope Carrey does more serious roles.

It encouraged building lethality so you could 1 shot someone just by landing E.

I simply wish to bonk turrets and champions, yet what is the state of Yorick this patch? You press E and the enemy champion dies. And now, with the upcoming nerfs directly to mist walkers and E, without any compensation Yorick is pretty much going to be in the same state as he was before buffs.

        "human_text": "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
        "direct_prompt": "\"Full Metal Jacket is a powerful and thought-provoking film that takes you on a journey through the brutal realities of war. The performances are outstanding, particularly from Matthew Modine as Private Joker, who expertly portrays the psychological toll of combat. Director Stanley Kubrick masterfully captures the intensity and chaos of battle while also exploring deeper themes such as the dehumanization of soldiers and the morality of warfare.

He was born in Omaha, Nebraska and raised in Imogene, Iowa. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1967, and is a member of the Jesuits' Midwest Province. Leahy earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's degree in United States history at Saint Louis University in 1972 and 1975, respectively. He then began studies at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley in Berkeley, California, where he earned degrees in theology (1978) and historical theology (1980). He was ordained a priest in 1978. He received a doctoral degree in U.S. history from Stanford University in 1986. He began his academic career as a teacher at Campion High School in Wisconsin from 1973 to 1975. He served as a teaching assistant at Stanford in 1981 before joining the Marquette University faculty as an instructor of history in 1985.

He played a key role in shaping US foreign policy during World War II and the early Cold War era.\n\nLeahy was born into a prominent Irish Catholic family in Boston, Massachusetts. After studying at Harvard University, he joined the US Foreign Service in 1899. Over the next several decades, he held various diplomatic posts around the world, including stints in Mexico, Germany, and Italy. In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him as ambassador to France, where he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to coordinate Allied efforts in World War II.\n\nDuring his tenure in Paris, Leahy became one of Roosevelt's closest advisors on European affairs. He played a central role in negotiating the 1940 Destroyers for Bases Agreement with Britain, which exchanged old US warships for rights to establish military bases in the Caribbean and Newfoundland. He also helped facilitate the 1941 Atlantic Charter meeting between FDR and Churchill, which laid out broad principles for postwar international cooperation.\n\nAfter the US entered World War II following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Leahy was named Chief of Staff to Supreme Commander Dwight Eisenhower in Europe. In this capacity, he played a crucial role in planning the Normandy Invasion and other major campaigns across North Africa and Italy. Following the war, he remained in Europe as head of the US Military Mission to Austria before being recalled to Washington to serve as Secretary of State Dean Acheson's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs.\n\nIn 1945, Leahy was sent to China as America's first peacetime ambassador to that country. During his four-year term, he oversaw the gradual withdrawal of US forces from the Chinese theater and attempted to navigate complex relations between Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government and Mao Zedong's Communist insurgents. Despite growing concerns about Soviet influence in Asia, however, Leahy ultimately concluded that the US should not intervene directly in China's civil war.\n\nFollowing his retirement from public service in 1949, Leahy returned to his native Boston and devoted himself to charitable work and writing. He published two memoirs – \"I Was There\" in 1950 and \"The Spearheads Roar\" in 1951 – detailing his",

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image. This is true even\nif no example for sky or person appeared in the training set. The net was\ntested and trained on the COCO panoptic dataset and achieved 67% IOU for\nsegmentation of familiar classes (that were part of the net training set) and\n53% IOU for segmentation of unfamiliar classes (that were not included in the\ntraining).",

The proposed approach demonstrates promising results in accurately identifying and separating different objects or regions within complex scenes without requiring any prior knowledge about their classes or categories.

        "human_text": "The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial. The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, which tends to be critical of the President, looks at possible fault lines. US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund. As soon as 2018, the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits.\nThe trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output.\nThis upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad. The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations. This does not bode well for US influence in the world. The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. The dollar is already sinking. Before too long, credit markets are likely to react, and interest rates will creep upwards. That will be the shock.\nInterest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing, automobiles, other consumer durables, agriculture, and small business. Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late 1970s. There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. The public outcry will force Congress to act. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. How did this happen?\nBy definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation. Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. In addition, the United States has two significant military missions. The Bush administration's chosen remedy is the least feasible one. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left. Law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean-up, economic development, the Small Business Administration, housing, veterans' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. It's fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. But serious savings can only be found where the big money is. Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private. Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent.\nOn the revenue side, the lion's share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced.\nSome rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway. Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. First on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue, simplify the tax code, and restore some fairness eroded by the Bush tax cuts. Second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to Afghanistan, Iraq, or terrorism. Third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.",
        "direct_prompt": "As Congress returns to Washington this week, they face an urgent task: avoiding a government shutdown and passing a spending bill before midnight on Friday. The deadline has been described as a “ticking time bomb” by lawmakers who are struggling to reach agreement on funding for President Trump's border wall, which is at the heart of the impasse.\n\nTalks between Republican and Democratic leaders have so far proved fruitless, with both sides dug in over their positions. Democrats refuse to provide any money for the wall, while Republicans insist that it must be funded. If no deal is reached by Friday, parts of the federal government could shut down again - just weeks after a record-breaking 35 day closure ended earlier this year.\n\nIn addition to averting a shutdown, members of congress also need to address another looming deadline related to the nation's debt limit. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned that the country will run out of borrowing capacity by late September or early October, potentially causing catastrophic economic consequences if left unaddressed.\n\nWith these pressing issues hanging over their heads, lawmakers return to Capitol Hill under intense pressure to find common ground and avoid yet another political crisis. As one senior Democrat put it, \"We're running out of time and options.\"",

Essentially, live streaming involves transmitting video and audio in real-time over the internet to viewers who can watch and listen simultaneously. This requires specialized software or hardware that encodes the content being streamed into a format suitable for transmission online. The encoded data then travels through various servers before reaching its destination where it's decoded back into visuals and sound for viewing on devices such as smartphones, computers, tablets, etc. With advancements in 5G networks and cloud computing, we're likely to see even more innovative uses cases emerge within this rapidly growing industry!",

Most terrorist attacks in Turkey have occurred in the southeastern and eastern provinces, and major cities like Ankara and Istanbul. The group Dev-Genç was founded in 1969 and involved in a string of kidnappings, bombings and bank robberies until martial law was declared in 1971. While these incidents were halted by 1973, attacks by the Armenian groups Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) and Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG) continued. Most of these attacks took place internationally, though there were some attacks within Turkey as well. For example, the May 1977 bombing of the Istanbul airport and the Ankara Esenboğa Airport attack. In Turkey protesting for Kurdish rights or supporting or demanding education in the Kurdish language is often also seen as supporting terrorism of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

In recent years, there have been renewed efforts towards peace talks between the Turkish government and representatives of the PKK.\n\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Eastern Syria Region (ISIL-ESR) is another group that has carried out terror attacks in Turkey.

        "human_text": "A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.\nThe German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. Mercedes-Benz's woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.\nMercedes' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003's 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.\nThe carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes' position as the world's most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler's shares fell 1.5% on the news. \"While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,\" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.\nIn contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.\nOverall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.\n\"The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,\" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler's profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting \"significant improvements\" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.",

The company's European market share fell from 15% last year to 13%, losing ground to German rivals Volkswagen AG which increased its lead over Toyota Motor Corp.\n\nFord had been counting on new models like the Kuga SUV and Puma small crossover to boost profits but these launches have failed to reverse declining fortunes amidst growing uncertainty about Brexit and weakening consumer confidence across Europe. In addition, customers are increasingly opting for luxury vehicles or SUVs rather than traditional family hatchbacks, hitting sales of popular models Focus and Fiesta hard.\n\nChief Executive Officer Jim Farley acknowledged there was 'work to do' after reporting an 8.% fall in overall EU vehicle deliveries during 2019 while rival VW saw growth despite ongoing emissions scandal fines weighing down profitability slightly. However this is expected to improve next year when electric versions of iconic Mustang muscle coupe along other electrified offerings will be introduced into line up helping revive flagging spirits at one time most valuable automaker globally worth $187 billion currently struggling against adversity.",

        "direct_prompt": "Healing in World of Warcraft's Battle for Azeroth expansion has been quite an interesting experience so far, especially with the introduction of linear scaling and artifact weapons being removed from the game. As someone who enjoys playing both healers and dps classes, I've had the chance to experiment with different specs and playstyles while leveling up my characters. While there have definitely been some challenges when it comes to adapting to the new system, overall I would say that healing feels more dynamic and engaging than ever before. \n\nOne thing that stands out to me is how much more involved I feel as a healer in combat situations. Instead of simply spamming heals and hoping for the best, I find myself constantly making decisions about which spells to use and when, based on the needs of my group and the dynamics of the fight. This sense of strategic depth is something that I haven't experienced since vanilla WoW, and it's really exciting to see Blizzard pushing the envelope in terms of what's possible within the MMO genre.\n\nOf course, there are still some aspects of the new healing system that take some getting used to. For example, having to manage multiple resources instead of relying solely on mana can be tricky at times, particularly during long fights or complex encounters where you need to balance your resource usage carefully. Additionally, certain abilities that were previously staples of my healing rotation have fallen by the wayside, leaving me feeling slightly lost at times when trying to figure out exactly what to do next.\n\nDespite these minor frustrations, however, I think that the benefits of the new healing system outweigh any potential drawbacks. Overall, I'd say that healing in BfA feels faster-paced, more rewarding, and more immersive than ever before - and that's saying something, given how many thousands of hours I've spent healing in MMORPGs over the years! If you're a fan of healing classes in World of Warcraft, I highly recommend giving the latest expansion a try - even if you weren't a big fan of previous iterations of the game's healing mechanics.",

Luckily, in the case of 'Semi-Pro,' he's the former. The film is clearly his vehicle, so whether it works or not is largely down to him. Here he plays Jackie Moon – the owner, coach and player of a low league basketball team who are about to get disbanded, unless they can scrape fourth place in the league.<br/><br/>For a start, you don't have to know or like basketball. I know nothing about it, but I enjoyed the film anyway. Yes, Ferrell is a little over the top here and there, but his performance never really borders on 'annoying.' It's not a long film, only an hour and a half, and most of it is packed with gags (all pretty adult in nature) and the majority of those work.<br/><br/>There are minor plot lines, but they're all secondary to Ferrell. Most other characters are only there to tee up Ferrell for him to deliver the punch line. Woody Harrelson is about the second most important character and he has a little more screen time. He's totally functional too, but Semi-Pro is still Ferrell's baby.<br/><br/>Basically, Semi-Pro won't win any awards. It's daft, loud and dumb, but ultimately very watchable if you're in the mood for a film like that.<br/><br/>Just beware of escaped bears!",
        "direct_prompt": "\"If you're looking for a lighthearted sports comedy with plenty of laughs and heart, look no further than Semi-Pro! Will Ferrell shines in his role as Jackie Moon, a struggling ABA team owner who dreams of making it to the NBA. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable performances from Andre Benjamin (Andre 3000) and Woody Harrelson. Director Kent Alterman keeps the pace fast and fun, balancing the humor with just the right amount of drama to keep things interesting. Overall, Semi-Pro is a winner that's sure to leave you smiling.\"",

In this paper, we explore techniques for quickly and\ndeterministically building a cluster state. In particular we consider\ngenerating cluster states on a qubus quantum computer, a computational\narchitecture which uses a continuous variable ancilla to generate interactions\nbetween qubits. We explore several techniques for building the cluster, with\nthe number of operations required depending on whether we allow the ability to\ndestroy previously created controlled-phase links between qubits. In the case\nwhere we can not destroy these links, we show how to create an n x m cluster\nusing just 3nm -2n -3m/2 + 3 operations. This gives more than a factor of 2\nsaving over a naive method. Further savings can be obtained if we include the\nability to destroy links, in which case we only need (8nm-4n-4m-8)/3\noperations. Unfortunately the latter scheme is more complicated so choosing the\ncorrect order to interact the qubits is considerably more difficult. A half way\nscheme, that keeps a modular generation but saves additional operations over\nnever destroying links requires only 3nm-2n-2m+4 operations. The first scheme\nand the last scheme are the most practical for building a cluster state because\nthey split up the generation into the repetition of simple sections.\n",

        "human_text": " Approximately 160 civilian scholars and scientists, many drawn from the Institut de France, collaborated on the Description. Collectively they comprised the Commission des Sciences et Arts d'Égypte. About a third of them would later also become members of the Institute of Egypt. In late August 1798, on the order of Napoleon, the Institute of Egypt (l'Institut d'Égypte) was founded in the palace of Hassan-Kashif on the outskirts of Cairo, with Gaspard Monge as president. The structure of the institute was based on the Institut de France. The institute housed a library, laboratories, workshops, and the savants' various Egyptian collections. The workshop was particularly important, supplying both the army as well as the servants with necessary equipment. Many new instruments were constructed as well, to replace those lost during the sinking of the French fleet in August 1798 at Aboukir Bay (Battle of the Nile) and the Cairo riot of October 1798. One of the goals of the Institute was to propagate knowledge. To this end, the savants published a journal, La Decade Egyptienne, as well as a newspaper, the Courier de L'Egypte, which disseminated information about the French occupation and the activities of the French army, the Commission des Sciences et Arts d'Égypte, and the Institute itself. The vision of a single comprehensive publication amalgamating all that the French discovered in Egypt was conceived already in November 1798, when Joseph Fourier was entrusted with the task of uniting the reports from the various disciplines for later publication. When the French army left Egypt in 1801, the savants took with them a large quantities of unpublished notes, drawings, and various collections of smaller artifacts that they could smuggle unnoticed past the British. In February 1802, at the instigation of Jean Antoine Chaptal, the French Minister of the Interior, and by decree of Napoleon, a commission was established to manage the preparation of the large amount of data for a single publication. The final work would draw data from the already-published journal La Decade, the newspaper Courier de L'Égypte, the four-volume Mémoires sur l'Égypte (an expansion of the La Decade journal, published by the French government during and after the Egyptian campaign) and an abundance of notes and illustrations from the various scholars and scientists. The huge volume of information to be published meant adopting an apparently haphazard modus operandi: when sufficiently many plates or text on a particular subject were ready, the information was published. Despite this, publication of the first edition took over 20 years. The first test volumes of engravings were presented to Napoleon in January 1808. Initially published by order of the emperor (Napoleon Le Grand), successive volumes would be published by order of the king, and the last simply by order of the government. A second edition (known as the Panckoucke edition) was published by Charles Louis Fleury Panckoucke. The text was expanded in more volumes and printed in a smaller formats, new pulls were taken from the plates, and these were bound with many of the large format plates folded in the smaller format volumes.",

Along the way, they encounter challenges such as harsh desert conditions and cultural differences, but persevere in their mission to document the rich history of Egypt.

The winner gets a deal with literary agency Curtis Brown. \"I'm not going to be the Mr Nasty of books,\" said Cowell, 54, in reference to his brother's caustic remarks on TV shows Pop Idol and The X-Factor. The 2004 winner, Paul Cavanagh, went on to sign a deal with Harper Collins.\nThis year, the competition is specifically looking for a crime writer. Writers must submit up to 10,000 words from the opening chapters of their novels and a synopsis. Professional readers will choose a shortlist of five following the competition closing date on 14 January.\nThe final five will then have to read their work in front of judging panel. A public vote will also take place, which will account for 25% of the final decision. The winner will be announced at the London Book Fair on 14 March next year and could be screened on TV. \"It's very, very hard to find an agent and extremely difficult, without an agent, to get a publisher to look at your work,\" said Cowell. \"People do fall by the wayside and the more avenues we can provide for aspiring authors, the better,\" he added. Paul Cavanagh, a former university professor and health care consultant from Ontario in Canada, was one of 1,466 aspiring novelists to enter the first contest.

The eventual victor was 29-year-old debut novelist Sarah Jones, whose historical romance novel captured the hearts of both judges and readers alike.\n\nJones, who had previously been working as a waitress while trying to break into the industry, said she never dreamed her book would go on to become such a success. She credited Lit Idol with giving her the platform and support needed to launch her career as a professional writer.\n\nThis year's edition of the contest marks a significant milestone for organisers, who hope to build upon last year's success and establish Lit Idol as a mainstay of the British literary scene.

        "human_text": "I liked the idea of Stranger than Fiction from the start. And I still like the idea after having seen the film. I was not a big fan of all the huge press first-time screenwriter Zach Helm was getting, but in comparison to the ballooning publicity with Sascha Baron Cohen and Borat!, it was not too bad. I continually looked forward to seeing the film, and am glad that the great trailer did not reveal everything like I had originally assumed.<br/><br/>The film involves Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent who lives his life by a very strict routine. One day, he wakes up, and begins to hear a woman narrating all of his actions. Suspicious, Crick continues attempting to live his life out, but after an inexplicable comment in regards to his \"immenent death\", he goes on the hunt for the voice. Randomly spliced into Crick's search is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson). She is writing a novel about a character named Harold Crick, and is unknowingly the voice Crick keeps hearing. She is battling a case of writer's block, and spends much of the film attempting to come up with the finale for the character.<br/><br/>Unlike many other existential comedies, Fiction is sweet and almost innocent in its design. Yes, the main focus of the film is pretty grim, but the life-altering questions that keep going around during the film do not become anywhere near as depressing and bizarre as those found in the likes of the work of Charlie Kaufman. In a way, Fiction feels a lot like a Kaufman-written film, but lacking in the means of being totally \"out there\"; almost like being a decaf as opposed to a regular. As a result, while being an excellent film (albeit slightly predictable), it cannot break past the mold already set by the likes of the absolutely brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It just feels like it is missing that spark that could have sprung it right into the brilliance that all films like this strive for.<br/><br/>Going along with the story itself, it feels a little ill-paced in some few instances, but for the most part sucks you right in and keeps you there. It has many comedic elements, and has some great dramatic sequences as well. They all play well, and while I still would not give him a ton of credit, I was very impressed by Helm's first-time effort. His writing feels vibrant and fresh, and in a film industry with absolutely little originality or thought, it is just great that movies like this slip through and get green-lighted. Every piece of dialogue and background feels well expressed, and just play out astonishingly well. On the topic of Crick however, I liked the idea of how neurotic and obsessive Crick was over numbers, but I thought it was a bit of an overkill to include special effect shots showing the numbers being counted within his head. It felt silly in The Da Vinci Code, so why did Sony feel the need to add it here too? <br/><br/>On that note, much like my being impressed by Adam Sandler from time to time, Ferrell really pulls through here, and does give the best performance of his short career. The psychological trauma that his character goes through is evident in his facial and body emotions, and the way he conveys it on screen is nowhere near what I would have expected. He brings an amazing sense of what this character is really about, and gives him a poignancy that makes him so life-like that it becomes almost too great to explain. This is a pathetically sad man who you cannot help but pull for as the film goes on. And for all the right reason too. He may deliver some of the funniest lines in the movie, but he is totally mature and at ease in this role. Thankfully this means that he stays serious for the most part throughout the film, and does not let any Ricky Bobby or Ron Bergundy slip out. He could have easily blown it, but thankfully, manages to stay in check.<br/><br/>Thompson is another particular standout, especially in contrast to Ferrell. She is broken and weak, searching for the perfect ending. The pain and sorrow that goes through her face as she writes and thinks has a poetic excellence to it, and she only continues to prove how good of an actor she is. Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah work well in supporting roles, supporting Ferrell and Thompson respectively as the film progresses on. Hoffman has always had great comedic timing, and he does not let it go to waste here. He plays right off of Ferrell in grand ways, and just feels totally at home in the role. Latifah, while not in the film so much, is very good in her bit parts. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shines here, and clearly has the makings for an Oscar sometime in the late future.<br/><br/>For its small problems, Fiction still is able to prove its worth, and is clearly one of the best films of the year. It will be able to stand proud among the other entries in the existential comedy genre, or just stand proud on its own. Helm's screenplay coupled in with an intoxicatingly great performance by Ferrell make for a great trip to the movies. And sure beats some of the crap that's been released over the past few weeks.<br/><br/>9/10.",

        "human_text": "Enamelin is an enamel matrix protein (EMPs), that in humans is encoded by the ENAM gene. It is part of the non-amelogenins, which comprise 10% of the total enamel matrix proteins. It is one of the key proteins thought to be involved in amelogenesis (enamel development). The formation of enamel's intricate architecture is thought to be rigorously controlled in ameloblasts through interactions of various organic matrix protein molecules that include: enamelin, amelogenin, ameloblastin, tuftelin, dentine sialophosphoprotein, and a variety of enzymes. Enamelin is the largest protein (~168kDa) in the enamel matrix of developing teeth and is the least abundant (encompasses approximately 1-5%) of total enamel matrix proteins. It is present predominantly at the growing enamel surface. Structure \nEnamelin is thought to be the oldest member of the enamel matrix protein (EMP) family, with animal studies showing remarkable conservation of the gene phylogenetically. All other EMPs are derived from enamelin, such as amelogenin. EMPs belong to a larger family of proteins termed 'secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins' (SCPP).",
        "direct_prompt": "Enamelin is a protein that plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of tooth enamel, which is the hard outer covering of teeth. It is secreted by ameloblasts, specialized cells found within the dental epithelium during tooth development.[1] Enamelin forms cross-linked networks with other proteins such as amelogenin to create the highly mineralized structure characteristic of tooth enamel[2]. The gene encoding for enamelin has been mapped to chromosome 11q13,[3] and mutations in this gene have been associated with various types of hypoplasia or aplasia affecting different parts of the dentition [4][5]. \n\nIn addition to its function in forming tooth enamel, recent studies suggest that enamelin may also play a part in regulating cell signaling pathways involved in bone remodeling processes outside of the oral cavity. This includes regulation of osteoclast differentiation through interaction with RANKL/OPG system  and modulation of Wnt pathway activity via binding to Frizzled receptors on osteoblast surface, thereby influencing bone mass accrual both locally at sites where teeth are formed but potentially elsewhere throughout skeleton too [[6],[7]]\n \nDespite being discovered over three decades ago, research into specific functions of individual enamel matrix proteins like Enamelin continues today due to their complex roles not only limited to biomineralization process alone; rather these molecules seem capable modulating cellular activities beyond just providing structural support when building our hardest tissues -teeth.",

As in the first book, Gump stumbles through historical American events through the 1980s and early 1990s. On the first page, Forrest Gump tells readers \"Don't never let nobody make a movie of your life's story,\" though \"Whether they get it right or wrong, it don't matter.\" However, the character is not an idiot savant, as in the first book, but more similar to Tom Hanks' \"kind hearted imp\". Frequent spelling and grammar mistakes, in the text, are used as a device to indicate the character's deficient education and cognitive difficulties. The story suggests that the real-life events surrounding the film have affected Forrest's life. Gump runs into Tom Hanks. He even goes on The David Letterman Show and attends the Academy Awards. He plays football for the New Orleans Saints, sells encyclopedias door-to-door, works on a pig farm, and helps develop the infamous New Coke. He accidentally crashes the Exxon Valdez, helps destroy the Berlin Wall, and fights in Operation Desert Storm with his friend, an orangutan named Sue (who survived a NASA mission and cannibals, with Gump, in the first book). He meets many celebrities, including Colonel Oliver North, the Ayatollah Khomeini, John Hinckley, Jim Bakker, Ivan Boesky, Ronald Reagan, Saddam Hussein, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Tom Hanks (who plays Forrest in the movie).

Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran. Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. \"I hope this day will focus people,\" Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, told the BBC News website.\nThe group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local Iranian embassies. The Committee has deemed Tuesday \"Free Mojtaba and Arash Day\" as part of its first campaign. It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other \"cyber-dissidents\". \"If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day',\" said Mr Hopkins. \"That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. That alone will shine some light on the situation. \"If you don't have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds.\" Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to a US research think-tank.\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director. She has since started the International Bloggers' Bill of Rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work. Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.\nThe Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. \"Blogging is in this weird no man's land. People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view,\" said Mr Hopkins. \"Some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. \"But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.\"\nIt is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.\n\"This is a big messy argument,\" explained Mr Hopkins. He added: \"It is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs.\" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Mr Hopkins, \"is part of the whole messy conversation.\" \"If you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. \"Everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,\" he said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. \"That is the essential difference. What I call 'templating software' gives every single person on Earth the chance to have one. \"You don't even have to have your own computer.\"",

This year's theme is climate change and the role that individuals and communities can play in addressing this critical issue.

Joanna spends time on the island with the companions of the Queen: Yarrow, Tansy, Pansy, and Goldenrod. She avoids several attempts by the Queen to steal her knitting bag. Finally she escapes and meets Ali the Boa Constrictor who guides her to the neighboring island Baba. On the way she meets the magician Gordon Johnson. Meanwhile, Ricky has met the Indian Chief Matinkatunk. They travel together until their horses, and Ricky's knife, are stolen by Tim Tumbleweed, who is really Yarrow in disguise. Ricky and the Chief are taken prisoner by King Willexander's henchmen and he is imprisoned in the Castle of the Upper Lowlands. Ricky is finally released when he agrees to accept a false knife from Yarrow. Joanna has been brought to the Castle, after leaving the island of Baba and rescuing Frederico from the Island Rhum. Joanna gives away her knitting, but not the knitting bag, to Princess Citronella in exchange for a turquoise which she thinks is the one lost by her cousin Emmeline. Joanna and Ricky finally get to Triple Peak, the home of the Magicians Congress, and a ghost town. They are reunited with Mrs Breadloaf, and travel to the battlefield of the impending war between the King and Queen. Both children parachute from a Dragon Jet and rescue friends and recover lost objects. The War is settled with the help of the Old Magician and the President, and Prince Culebra Ali is transformed from a snake back into a man. In the final scenes, Joanna and Ricky return to the magic window and climb back into their Uncle's house where they are reunited with all their relatives, and their parents.",

        "human_text": "Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\nAmerica's former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. Collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. The 33-year-old was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer. The sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the CAS has upheld USADA's findings. \"The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG,\" said a CAS statement. \"Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time.\" So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal. World record holder Tim Montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the USADA. His hearing before the CSA has been rescheduled for June next year.\nDrug enforcement chiefs in the US have vowed to crack down on cheats. USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that. \"The CAS panel's decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of USADA's ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of US athletes that compete drug-free,\" said Madden. The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results. The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges. The trial is expected to open next March.",
        "direct_prompt": "In a historic ruling, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that it will ban all Russian athletes from participating in this year's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The decision comes after an extensive investigation into allegations of state-sponsored doping by Russia's athletics team.\n\nThe IOC Executive Board met on Tuesday to discuss the findings of an independent commission led by former World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president Dick Pound. The report concluded that there was evidence of a systemic conspiracy to cover up doping violations within the Russian athletic program.\n\nAs a result, the IOC has decided to suspend the entire Russian delegation from competing under their national flag at the upcoming Games. Instead, they will be allowed to participate as neutral athletes, wearing uniforms bearing the OAR abbreviation (Olympic Athlete from Russia).\n\nThis is the first time that an entire nation has been barred from competing at the Olympics due to doping offenses. It represents a significant shift in the IOC's approach to tackling cheating in sport and sends a strong message to other countries who may be tempted to engage in similar practices.\n\nHowever, some critics have argued that the punishment does not go far enough and that more drastic measures should have been taken to punish those responsible for the scandal. Others have questioned whether it is fair to punish innocent athletes who had no involvement in the doping scheme.\n\nDespite these concerns, the IOC insists that the decision was necessary to restore trust in sports and ensure fairness for all competitors. The organization also stressed that individual cases would continue to be reviewed before any athlete can compete under the OAR banner.\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics are set to begin on February 9th in Pyeongchang, with thousands of athletes from around the world expected to take part in events such as figure skating, alpine skiing, and ice hockey.",

As soon as the coffee starts to fill the reservoir, pour about 1/2 tablespoon of coffee over the sugar and return the espresso maker to the heat.

        "human_text": "A crime family is a unit of an organized crime syndicate, particularly in Italian organized crime (and especially in the Sicilian Mafia and Italian-American Mafia), often operating within a specific geographic territory or a specific set of activities. In its strictest sense, a family (or clan) is a criminal gang, operating either on a unitary basis or as an organized collection of smaller gangs (e.g., cells, factions, crews, etc.).  In turn, a family can be a sole \"enterprise\" or part of a larger syndicate or cartel. Despite the name, most crime families are generally not based on or formed around actual familial connections, though many members may in fact be related to one another. Origins\nThe origins of the term come from the Sicilian Mafia.  In the Sicilian language, the word cosca, which is the crown of spiny, closely folded leaves on plants such as the artichoke or the thistle, symbolizes the tightness of relationships between members.  The word cosca is also used for clan. In the early days of the Mafia, loose groups of bandits organized themselves into associations that over time became more organized, and they adopted the term based on both of its meanings.",
        "direct_prompt": "A crime family, also known as a criminal organization or syndicate, is a group of individuals who engage in organized crime. These groups are often composed of relatives and associates whose primary goal is to make money through illegal activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, gambling, racketeering, robbery, smuggling, and murder. Crime families may operate locally or on a national level, with some even having international reach. They typically have a hierarchical structure similar to that of legitimate businesses, with leaders making decisions about strategy and operations. Members of these organizations usually specialize in specific roles within the operation, including enforcers, financiers, and street-level dealers.\n\nThe origins of modern crime families can be traced back to the mafia, which emerged in Italy during the late 19th century. The Italian-American Mafia, commonly referred to as the Mob, has since become one of the most well-known examples of this type of organization. However, there are many other types of crime families around the world, each with their own unique characteristics and methods of operation. Some notable examples include the Yakuza in Japan, Triads in Hong Kong and China, and various Latin American cartels.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies frequently investigate and attempt to dismantle crime families through tactics like wiretapping, surveillance, and undercover operations. In recent years, several high-profile arrests and prosecutions have led to the disruption of numerous major crime families across the United States and elsewhere. Despite these efforts, however, crime families continue to exist and adapt to changing circumstances, sometimes evolving into more sophisticated and elusive organizations.",

I think it’s pretty obvious that he’s a Zeltron or maybe a Falleen. I have a few theories as to his past. 1. He was trained by Jadus. Zhorrid is described as Jadus’ “ only known apprentice” so it’s possible he had others and the timing lines up with Rivix being active pre Vector joining the Killiks. Jadus was also willing to use aliens to achieve his goals. Rivix being an agent of Jadus would be a good way to introduce Jadus as the next big bad. 2. He’s a Jedi spy. In the original cut expansion there was going to be a Falleen Sith named Zujen Vale in the Sith Warrior story. Zujen worked for the Emperor’s Hand. Zujen would be revealed as a Jedi and as an agent of Gnost-Dural. They could easily reuse this plot or make him an agent of Sal-Deron. 3. He works for an unknown faction. I feel like this is the most unlikely option but the only reason I’m including it is I wonder if the might use the force user who trained Guss as a new antagonist.",

Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. <br/><br/>The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! <br/><br/>For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it.

        "human_text": "Erythrocyte fragility refers to the propensity of erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBC) to hemolyse (rupture) under stress. It can be thought of as the degree or proportion of hemolysis that occurs when a sample of red blood cells are subjected to stress (typically physical stress, and most commonly osmotic and/or mechanical stress). Depending on the application as well as the kind of fragility involved, the amount of stress applied and/or the significance of the resultant hemolysis may vary. When multiple levels of stress are applied to a given population/sample of cells, a fragility profile can be obtained by measuring the relative or absolute extent of hemolysis existing at each such level, in addition to finding one or more single-number indexes (either measured directly or interpolated) associated with particular respective levels of hemolysis and/or corresponding stress. Fragility testing can be useful to assess cells' ability (or lack thereof) to withstand sustained or repeated stress. Moreover, it can be used to assess how fragility itself varies under different or changing environmental or stress conditions, during or prior to the inducement of the hemolysis. Low fragility is often termed \"stability,\" though technically stability refers to cells' resistance to both stress-induced lysis and spontaneous auto-lysis.",
        "direct_prompt": "Erythrocyte fragility refers to the tendency of red blood cells (RBCs) or erythrocytes to become damaged and break apart more easily than normal. This can lead to anemia, which is characterized by a decrease in the number of RBCs or their hemoglobin content. There are several factors that contribute to erythrocyte fragility, including certain medical conditions such as sickle cell disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and spherocytosis. Additionally, medications like oxalate-containing compounds may also cause erythrocyte fragility. The severity of erythrocyte fragility varies among individuals depending on genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Treatment for this condition typically involves addressing any underlying causes and managing symptoms with medication or blood transfusions if necessary. Regular monitoring of CBC counts along with reticulocyte count helps detect early signs of hemolysis due to erythrocyte fragility.",

        "human_text": "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",

The original premise - that the mother does not remember what happened in the mirror house, is perfectly logical. She has amnesia due to fear.

In 2010 he set four world records in four days, and at the 2011 World Championships he won a gold in the 10,000 metres and four silver medals, losing the gold in three events to long term rival David Weir. This rivalry continued into the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, where Hug won two silvers, in the 800m and the marathon. In the 2013 World Championships Hug dominated the field, winning five golds and a silver. During the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Hug was one of the most consistent competitors in the T54 class, winning two golds, in the 800 m and marathon, and two silvers medals, in the 1500m and 5000m.

The firms denied that they are about to link up, but said they are examining ways of working more closely together. SMFG shares climbed by 2.7% to 717,000, and Daiwa added 5.3% to 740 yen.\nCombining SMFG, Japan's third-biggest lender, and Daiwa, the country's second-largest brokerage firm, would create a company with assets of more than $1,000bn (£537bn). SMFG President Yoshifumi Nishikawa said that the companies needed to bolster their businesses. \"Both companies need to strengthen retail and other operations,\" he said, adding that \"it's an issue we have in common\". Daiwa said that \"although it is true that the two groups have been engaging in various discussions to enhance cooperation, there are no plans to enter into negotiations to consolidate the two businesses\". Analysts said that consolidation in Japan's financial sector was likely to continue and that it was likely to have a positive impact on earnings. \"Cross-selling opportunities between banks and brokers are increasing thanks to deregulation, so we can expect the relationship to get even stronger,\" said Heronry Nozaki, an analyst at NikkoCitigroup.

It is hoped that this shift towards merit-based compensation will help boost productivity within the industry.\n\n\"This kind of reform hasn't happened overnight,\" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \"But with competition intensifying both domestically and globally, it was only a matter of time before companies started looking seriously at ways to improve efficiency through changes like these.\"\n\nShares of several large banking groups including MUFG Bank Ltd., SMBC Niigata Securities Incorporated, and Resona Holdings inc saw gains of between 1% and 3%, reflecting investor optimism about potential improvements in profitability stemming from greater emphasis on talent management.\n\nHowever, there remains skepticism regarding whether cultural barriers can truly be overcome when it comes to changing deeply ingrained attitudes around job security and career advancement.-BBC News",

It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car \"DeLorean\" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love \"Back to the Future\" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.<br/><br/>I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. <br/><br/>Back to the Future Part II (1989)<br/><br/>The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. <br/><br/>Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.<br/><br/>Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with \"DeLorean\" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles.

        "human_text": "The Alden staRRcar, short for \"Self-Transport Road and Rail Car\", was a personal rapid transit (PRT) system designed by William Alden in the 1960s. It originally envisioned small electrically powered cars suitable for short distance trips at low speed within urban areas, which could optionally merge onto tracks that would provide power and guidance for high-speed travel over longer inter-city distances. It was one of the earliest dual-mode vehicles to be proposed, and one of the earliest to be actually built. Over its lifetime the design changed dramatically, originally a four-person vehicle with dual-mode operation but eventually emerging as a much larger people mover for 20 people. In this form, Boeing Vertol was awarded a construction contract in 1970 to build a demonstration system in Morgantown, West Virginia. A smaller system was also built by their licensee, Kobe Steel, and installed at the Expo '75 on Okinawa (as well as the more advanced CVS). The Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit system first opened for service in 1975, and with the exception of a closure for a major expansion, has remained in service since then.",
        "direct_prompt": "Alden staRRcar was an American artist known for his unique and innovative approach to creating art. Born in New York City in 1929, Alden grew up with a passion for drawing and painting, eventually studying at the Art Students League of New York before embarking on a career as a commercial illustrator. However, it wasn't until he discovered the medium of light projection that Alden's work truly came into its own.\n\nUsing powerful projectors mounted atop modified automobiles (hence the name'staRRcar'), Alden created large-scale, site-specific installations that transformed entire buildings or city blocks into vibrant, moving works of art. His pieces often incorporated abstract shapes and patterns, sometimes accompanied by music or sound effects, to create immersive environments that captivated viewers.\n\nOne of Alden's most famous projects was \"Cosmic Carnival,\" a multi-night event held in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in 1967. Using three separate vehicles outfitted with custom projector systems, Alden filled the night sky with swirling colors and intricate designs, attracting tens of thousands of spectators over the course of the weekend. The success of this piece helped establish aldren starrar as one of the leading figures in the emerging field of video mapping and digital sculpture.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, alden continued to push the boundaries of projected media, collaborating with musicians like Stevie Wonder and Pink Floyd to create visually stunning live performances. He also worked extensively in film and television, contributing special visual effects to movies such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. Despite declining health towards the end of his life, Alten remained committed to his craft right up until his passing in 2002.\n\nToday, Adlen starrrcar is remembered as a visionary artist who used technology to expand our understanding of what art can be. His groundbreaking work continues to inspire new generations of creators, proving that even the simplest tools - in this case, a car and some lights - can be used to produce something truly extraordinary.",

The soldiers destroy the facility, but all save two of the three hundred SPARTANs are killed. The narrative then moves back to 2531, where SPARTAN-IIs are deployed against human insurrectionists; though the team is almost captured, the timely intervention of Kurt-051 allows the team to complete their mission. Meanwhile, Colonel James Ackerson meets with the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Ackerson announces his plan to create a new breed of SPARTANs which retains much of the supersoldiers' effectiveness, without the high price tag of the SPARTAN-II program. These SPARTAN-IIIs are trained by Franklin Mendez, as well as Kurt-051. With his death staged by ONI, Kurt-051 is placed in full charge of SPARTAN-III training, under the name and rank of Lieutenant Kurt Ambrose. The SPARTAN-III project is carried out on a secret ONI planet named Onyx, where there is also an archaeological excavation of ancient Forerunner ruins in an area known as \"Zone 67\". When a company of SPARTAN-IIIs goes missing in Zone 67, it is declared off-limits to all personnel. Like the SPARTAN-IIs, the SPARTAN-III candidates undergo radical cybernetic and biological enhancements and are outfitted with special armor to increase their abilities. The first SPARTAN-III company proves highly successful, but is wiped out when ordered to destroy a Covenant orbital shipyard in 2537. Shaken by the massacre of his troops, Kurt improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN-III recruits, but they too are all killed in action so Kurt, in an effort to reduce casualties, institutes illegal biological modifications on the third company of SPARTANs. While conducting a training exercise near Zone 67, UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien robotic drones. Meanwhile, Dr. Catherine Halsey, the SPARTAN-II project's creator, along with the SPARTAN Kelly-087 arrive in the Onyx system. As they near the surface of the planet they are attacked by more robot drones and crash, meeting up with the human survivors of the attacks. Halsey identifies the robotic drones as Forerunner Sentinels from the artificial intelligence Cortana's logs of the events of Halo: Combat Evolved. Halsey sends a message back to Earth, which is under attack by Covenant; in response, Lord Hood sends the SPARTAN-IIs Fred-104, Linda-058, and Will-043 to Onyx. At the Forerunner ringworld Delta Halo, the Covenant are in the midst of a war. Elites intercept Halsey's distress signal and learn of the existence of Onyx and its Forerunner technology. Both the Covenant and the UNSC forces which arrive at Onyx are attacked by Sentinels. The entire UNSC fleet at Onyx is destroyed by the ensuing battle, save for one stealth ship, the Dusk, which stays hidden, observing the events. The remaining human forces on Onyx discover a Forerunner city being rapidly uncovered by the Sentinels, and are guided into a massive sphere by Dr. Halsey. She determines that the entire planet is actually a \"Shield World\" constructed by the Forerunners to protect themselves from the firing of the Halo ringworlds, which are designed to eradicate all sentient life. Fighting off Covenant pursuers, the humans discover an entrance leading to a Dyson Sphere. Kurt remains behind in order to detonate two nuclear weapons to stop the Covenant from following the humans into the Sphere. Hiding at a distance from Onyx, the Dusk watches as Onyx's surface rips apart to reveal that the entire world is constructed of Sentinels, all connected together to provide an impenetrable defense around the Dyson Sphere at the heart of the planet. The Sentinels annihilate the remaining Covenant fleet vessels orbiting the planet and the Prowler retreats.

However, the predictive performance of these algorithms\ndepends on the quality of labels. This problem is particularly pertinent in the\nmedical image domain, where both the annotation cost and inter-observer\nvariability are high. In a typical label acquisition process, different human\nexperts provide their estimates of the \"true\" segmentation labels under the\ninfluence of their own biases and competence levels. Treating these noisy\nlabels blindly as the ground truth limits the performance that automatic\nsegmentation algorithms can achieve. In this work, we present a method for\njointly learning, from purely noisy observations alone, the reliability of\nindividual annotators and the true segmentation label distributions, using two\ncoupled CNNs. The separation of the two is achieved by encouraging the\nestimated annotators to be maximally unreliable while achieving high fidelity\nwith the noisy training data. We first define a toy segmentation dataset based\non MNIST and study the properties of the proposed algorithm. We then\ndemonstrate the utility of the method on three public medical imaging\nsegmentation datasets with simulated (when necessary) and real diverse\nannotations: 1) MSLSC (multiple-sclerosis lesions); 2) BraTS (brain tumours);\n3) LIDC-IDRI (lung abnormalities). In all cases, our method outperforms\ncompeting methods and relevant baselines particularly in cases where the number\nof annotations is small and the amount of disagreement is large.

The team, dubbed \"Icebreaker\", waste no time double-crossing each other. Ostensibly their job is to root out the leader of the murderous National Socialist Action Army (NSAA), Count Konrad von Glöda. The Count used to be known as Arne Tudeer, a one-time Nazi SS officer who now perceives himself as the new Adolf Hitler. The National Socialist Action Army is essentially a new wave of fascism as a means to wipe out communist leaders and supporters around the world. The novel is full of double-crosses and even triple-crosses where the agents and agencies go without sharing their true loyalties with one another. The American agent, for instance, first appears to be a good guy then later in cahoots with von Glöda, and then still even later a good guy once again. Things become even more complicated when the Israeli agent, Rivke, is revealed to be the daughter of von Glöda/Tudeer and her allegiance, although appearing to be legitimate, in doubt. The Russian agent also double-crosses Bond in hopes of capturing him for KGB interrogation. Bond gets several weeks of driving training from Erik Carlsson as preparation for this Arctic assignment.",

They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.\n\"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\n\"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\"\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\"",
        "direct_prompt": "LONDON - The new comedy series created by Ricky Gervais has attracted an impressive list of A-list celebrities, including some of Hollywood's most recognizable faces. \n\nThe show, which is set to premiere on Netflix later this year, features appearances from stars such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Judi Dench and Idris Elba. According to insiders, more big names are expected to join the cast as production continues.\n\nGervais himself will star in the show alongside his long-time collaborator, Stephen Merchant. Together, they have previously worked on hit comedies like Extras and The Office.\n\nThis latest project marks a return to form for Gervais, who has been largely absent from television screens since the end of his controversial Golden Globe hosting stint in 2010. However, with these high profile guest spots, it seems that he is back and better than ever.\n\nDetails about the plot of the upcoming programme remain under wraps, but sources close to the production have hinted at a darkly comic storyline involving death and mortality. Whatever the subject matter, one thing is certain: with this stellar line up of talent involved, it is sure to be must-see TV.",

Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003. Other new artists in this year's list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third. The Bravery played their first gig in 2003 and have since supported bands including The Libertines, Interpol and Echo and the Bunnymen.\nThey were the subject of a record company bidding war in 2004 and their debut single, Unconditional, caused a huge buzz when it was released in the UK in November. Singer Sam Endicott said he felt \"great\" about coming top of the Sound of 2005 list. \"Anyone that says they don't want a zillion screaming fans is a jackass, a liar,\" he said. One of the experts to tip The Bravery was The Times' music critic Paul Connolly, who said they were \"spiky but in love with pop\". Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Music's chart show, said the band had \"great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound\". \"The Bravery are proof alone that New York City is still home to hot new talent,\" he said. Nigel Harding, head of music at London rock radio station Xfm, said every track from their live set \"sounded like a potential single\".\nUnconditional reached the summit of the station's listeners' chart within a fortnight of its first play, which Mr Harding described as \"an unheard of achievement for a debut single\".\nQ magazine reviews editor Ted Kessler said they were \"pretty-boy New York clothes horses\" with \"an unusually nimble ear for concise, yearning pop in the mould of Duran Duran or The Strokes\". Other pundits to take part in the survey included BBC Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson, NME editor Conor McNicholas, Top of the Pops presenter Fearne Cotton, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis and BBC Radio 2 music editor Colin Martin. Elsewhere on the top 10, second-placed rock band Bloc Party began their rise after supporting Franz Ferdinand and UK garage MC Kano, in third, is signed to The Streets' record label. US rapper The Game is hip-hop great Dr Dre's latest protege while Leeds group Kaiser Chiefs came fifth with a promise to lead a Britpop revival. In last year's survey, Keane were followed by Franz Ferdinand, Razorlight and Joss Stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point.\nBoy band McFly were sixth while Scissor Sisters, who had the UK's best-selling album of 2004, were seventh. In the survey, the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre, either in terms of sales or critical acclaim. The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor. Those tips were then counted and compiled to make the top 10.",

Despite taking a hiatus in 2013, they reunited last year and began touring again, much to the delight of fans worldwide.\n\nFrontman Julian Casablancas expressed his gratitude towards those who voted for them, stating: \"It means everything to us knowing that our music still resonates with people all these years later.\" He also hinted at new material being worked on but refused to give any specific details about when we can expect another release from the iconic quartet.\n\nOther notable mentions include Billie Eilish who took home awards for Best New Artist and Songwriter of the Year while her hit single 'Bad Guy' won Video of the Year. Taylor Swift claimed Album of the Year honors for her latest record Lover, which has already sold over 1 million copies globally within its first week of release.\n\nThis year's ceremony is set to take place next month where winners will be announced live on television before an audience filled with stars and industry insiders alike.

        "human_text": "Don't look at the movie the way it is. You can hate it for whatever reasons you like but this movie isn't just stupid, soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. There is more thought put into it than you could ever imagine. Too bad critics panned the movie for the things that couldn't comprehend and the audience went with it.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a big fantasy that does not exist or happening in the real world. The movie is actually about Sweet Pea(Abbie Cornish). She is the star of the show. Snyder made that very clear from the start. Babydoll(Emily Browning) is a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination. She is the physical embodiment of Sweet Pea. She is the 5th thing. She is the guardian angel that Sweet Pea created to deal with her trash life. The entire film is a reflection of the internal struggle of Sweet Pea. That's why she is the one who's narrating the film. The stuff that we've seen with Babydoll during the first act, that's all Sweet Pea acting out her past trauma in her mind, just as she was taught to do in the mental institution. That's why the movie opens on a stage that direct parallel to how Sweet Pea is acting out that same trauma on a stage when Babydoll first arrives in the mental institution aka the theater. After that, the lobotomy comes, the key to everything that happens in the movie. Reimagined through Babydoll perspective, Sweet Pea disassociates from reality when the needle plunges into her brain, retreating into her mind in the same way she's taught to by Dr. Gorski. She's not in the real world anymore. This is also what happened in Sweet Pea's real life. And the effect of that lobotomy is the goddamned movie. Yes, this movie is the result of a lobotomy. Just one big subconscious coping mechanism for Sweet Pea to find peace. And this girl is able to interrupt the lobotomy, intruding on her own story. She's even able to repurpose the accidental killing of her sister into a deliberate and necessary sacrifice on her sister's part to save her. In this second layer of fantasy, Sweet Pea imagines herself and the rest of the girls working in a brothel, objectified and lusted after by an audience. This mirrors us tuning in to see these girls perform for us in various outfits. This connection is made clear from the opening of the film, which lets us know that we're the audience watching all this unfold on stage. By choosing to watch the movie, we are complicit in everything that's happening. Of course, this doesn't mean to condemn you for wanting to see nubile girls kicking ass. What this movie is really about is the difference between empowerment and exploitation. This is represented through three layers of fantasy, first was the mental institution, second is the brothel, third is the fantasy-action scenes, each exploring a different set of social values, each aligning with different phases of the feminist movement. First up is a grim incarnation of the '60s -the mental institution- set during the second wave of the feminist movement, when gender inequality was much more widespread. That gender inequality is amplified in the second world -the brothel- which takes us back even further, to a time when women were literally treated like property. And finally we have the pop culture world -the world of today, action scenes- which imagines Babydoll's dancing through various aspects of modern geek culture, dressing the girls up in all the typical fetishistic attire we've come to expect video games, TV, movies, etc... Sweet Pea is aware of how sick this is and rejects that Baby Doll's dancing could possibly be empowering. It's only through seeing its effect on men does she start to see how much power they really have, as the girls start taking back the control they've lost by using men's objectification of them to their advantage. By embracing their sexuality instead of fearing it, they learn that their inherent femininity can be better used as a means of holding men under their sway. Suddenly, it's the men who become helpless instead of them. Point being, men may be in a position to physically overpower women, but women have the power to psychologically overpower men, thus inverting history's long-standing power dynamic between men and women. This is then mirrored to very much the same effect in the action fantasy scenarios - a symbolic gesture on Snyder's part to show women taking back geek culture, which men have been dominating with their boy club mentality and pervasive misogyny for far too long. This is demonstrated further once we cut back to Babydoll's lobotomy after Sweet Pea has found peace. While Sweet Pea busy imagining that she's taking the magic school bus to a better world, Blue has plans of his own. But its no use, she's already escaped, even if it's only mentally. Sweet Pea sacrifices her body -Babydoll- and retreats into the comfort of her own mind, a paradise over which nobody has control of but her. Blue may have control over her body, but without her mind, he has nothing. The importance of this is also apparent during Babydoll's encounter with the High Roller, who recognizes that the choice to truly be with someone lies with you and you alone. As the scene with the High Roller reaffirms, the distinction between exploitation and empowerment all comes down to personal choice. And that is just half of the point this movie trying to make. Women deserve just as much control over their bodies as they have over their minds. You can interpret this movie so many ways, it's beyond belief. It gives you so many options to think. It's really funny that the one who made this kind of a movie and the one who is trying to defend it is a male. But it is what it is. If this movie made by someone like Stanley Kubrick, probably everyone would have tried to decipher the depth of it and wouldn't have even minded the bad reviews.<br/><br/>It's really sad that people turn off their brains and see everything literal, and never uses their brain to read the images that appear on the screen when they see a Snyder film.",
        "direct_prompt": "\"Visually stunning and thought-provoking, Sucker Punch takes you on a wild journey through the minds of five young girls trapped in a mental institution. The ensemble cast shines as they bring their characters to life with depth and emotion. The action sequences are fast-paced and thrilling, perfectly complemented by the film's immersive soundtrack. While some may criticize its portrayal of women or find fault with certain plot holes, overall this is a unique and powerful film that deserves recognition.\"",

        "direct_prompt": "Brian Thomas Swimme (born October 31, 1942) is an American cosmologist and theologian. He has been described as one of the leading proponents of the New Cosmology or Epic of Evolution.[1] His work explores the implications of modern cosmology for spirituality,[2][3] particularly in relation to Christian theology[4] but also engaging with other religious traditions such as Buddhism [5]. \n\nSwimme holds degrees from University College Dublin(BSc), Yale Divinity School,(Mdiv.)and California Institute of Integral Studies where he earned his PhD under the guidance of Ken Wilber.He was formerly a Catholic priest before leaving active ministry due to disagreements over issues related to birth control,but continued exploring connections between science & religion through teaching at various universities including Harvard divinity school&Yale university among others.  His most well-known works include The Hidden Heart of the Cosmos: Humanity's Place In An Evolving Universe coauthored with Mary Evans;The Powers Of The Universe : Exploring Our Present Understanding And Future Potential which presents scientific discoveries about our universe alongside insights drawn from ancient wisdom teachings ;Journey OF THE UNIVERSE series that uses storytelling along side imagery taken by Hubble telescope to explore themes like cosmic evolution,the emergence of complexity,& consciousness. These books have gained popularity not only within academic circles but wider public audience interested in understanding how latest findings on origins/structure of everything we see can inform spiritual quests.& environmental concerns alike.\n    \nIn recent years Brian swimme together with his wife and collaborator,Mary evans authored book called 'A Walk Through Time' aimed towards young readers aged 8 -12 introducing them concepts discussed above via story form accompanied illustrations. This effort further demonstrates commitment toward making complex ideas accessible beyond narrow confines academia while inspiring new generation ponder their place amidst unfolding epic evolutionary journey visible throughout observable realm.\n\n   \nOverall, Brian’s contributions are significant because they bridge gap often perceived existing sciences vs humanities /religions domains thereby enriching both fields simultaneously. Despite some criticism received regarding certain aspects interpretations presented especially those touching upon theological matters many admirers regard him pioneer whose groundbreaking efforts continue inspire fresh perspectives reevaluating longstanding assumptions underlying worldviews held dear humanity since dawn time itself.",
